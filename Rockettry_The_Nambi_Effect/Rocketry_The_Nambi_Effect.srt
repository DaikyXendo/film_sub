We should learn how to
be responsible only from you, ma!

18
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,800
I am expected to be a good mother,
great wife and dutiful daughter-in-law

19
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,300
But none of you will lift
your little finger for me

20
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,380
3 hours since I woke up
No time for even a sip of water

21
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,300
One of you could have
offered me coffee, right?

22
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,460
Subtle hint from your mother
you should've got coffee from home!

23
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,340
My dear Einstein husband, I got that

24
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,090
Amma, you know how much
I missed your lamenting sessions

25
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,210
Divert your anger on my sari
and burn a big hole

26
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,380
I'll have a good excuse then
not to turn up for the wedding today

27
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,880
Give me your hand

28
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,340
- Show me your bangles
- Amma!

29
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,750
I'll pickle you to pieces

30
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
I'm so patient only because
my son-in-law is here

31
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,500
I've promised the bride's family
100% attendance from our side

32
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,920
If you ditch me today, that's it

33
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,050
I won't give a damn for our family dignity
and dance like a woman possessed, mind you!

34
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,710
- You never know, she may do it
- Amma, please

35
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,630
I'll leave immediately
after my lecture

36
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,590
- Promise
- Wait at the college bus stop

37
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,210
I'll pick you up at 12

My dear son....tea!

41
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,630
Do you have an iota of responsibility?

42
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,880
Try to be part of this family at least once

43
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,590
This is one of our close relative's wedding
At least be punctual for the wedding feast!

44
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,750
Every single member here
expects a special invitation

45
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,170
[Holy chant]

46
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,300
Isn't it ages since we attended
any function as a family together?

47
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,590
My relatives have forgotten
the very fact I am married

48
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,840
As if he remembers he is married either!

49
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,590
He is busy night and day
romancing with his rockets

50
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,670
Fine, I am destined to
be wedded to a scientist

51
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,750
My children are a few notches worse

52
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,710
Why did you leave out your son-in-law?

53
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,800
Sometimes I wonder if he is
a rocket scientist or an astrologer!

54
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,420
He shifts your granddaughter from our bed
and sleeps with this almanac instead of me-

55
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,840
'Finished your prayers?'

56
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,920
Does it mean whoever works in NASA
isn't bothered about our nation?

57
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,500
If you were at NASA,
by now we would be

58
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,250
...living in the lap of luxury,
bungalow, fancy car, beefy body guar-

59
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,300
Who is saying 'no'?

60
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,340
Your Elizabeth is still
the headhunter at NASA!

61
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,130
Just nod your head
we can leave tomorrow

62
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,000
I didn't mean it like that

63
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,630
Okay, forget all these creature comforts

64
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,800
We have to attend
a family wedding today

65
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,880
Can't you fulfil my desire at least 1 day?

66
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,050
Is that so?
What kind of desire?

67
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,380
Tell me clearly what desires
you want me to fulfil?

68
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,710
- Go on
- Geetha

69
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,710
Bring back your imp's cradle here

70
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,170
- Why?
- I think it may come in handy!

71
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,420
Shankar, I'll spank you

72
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,460
Hey! You are saying I can still
launch rockets from home?

73
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,750
Go ahead, but those rockets
will only be firing blanks!

74
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,630
Shame on all of you, yuck!

75
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,170
I'm going to the temple

76
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,710
Don't jinx it! How many times
I've told you to say 'I will be back'?

77
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,750
Today is an important day
for you, right?

78
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,050
Take care
See you soon

79
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,300
I'm going only to the temple nearby
You think I'm off to Mars or what?

80
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,050
Mars is sure to have less pot holes
than the roads in Trivandrum!

81
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,960
Uncle, today I intend seeing
the KVD-1 engines assembly

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,420
Arun, haven't I told you it's inauspicious
to call a person when he is stepping out?

83
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,250
That too, a special day for him

returning to Chennai tonight

much more than any of us

Forgive me for asking, sir

140
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,880
If you think this interview
is such a futile exercise

141
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,670
Why should we do this?

142
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,590
Why did you come here?

143
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,050
Why did I come?

144
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,420
No one else in our country should
go through what I had to endure

145
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,090
The people responsible for this crime
should be brought to justice

146

given up on the likes of me

'But we cannot be like that, Mr Suriya'

Because I still believe
in the goodness of our people

149
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,210
And the integrity of this nation

150

That's why I'm here

We share the same faith
and trust in you

has brought us here tonight

157
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,210
So can we start this interview
from your interaction with him?

158
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,210
Wow!

159
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,340
Not reducing my entire life
to that spy case and scandal

160
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,630
Thank you for doing
the due diligence on me

161
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,590
'You are right'

162
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,090
Vikram Sarabhai

163
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,380
He was more than a mentor
He was like a father to me

164
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,670
And as his spoilt, adamant son
I used to enjoy going wild in ISRO

165
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,300
[indistinct muttering]

166
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,380
Hey quiet!

167
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,880
Nambi, please

168
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,130
Coming 1 day before the test and claim
the experiment isn't working is foolishness

169
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,710
If this can ignite here, for sure it will
ignite in the upper atmosphere also

170
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,130
Kalam, nothing will change
just by you staring at it

171
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,840
Let's call it off

172
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
'Call it off?'

173
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,630
Is this some dance drama?

174
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,090
Start and stop according
to our whims and fancies

175
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,550
6 nations are jointly observing us

176
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,250
Some American scientist said something

177
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,420
You concur and now
chew my brains on it?

178
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,500
Just reset it

179
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,380
Pump

180
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,170
Little more mixture please

181
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,130
Carbon connectors

182
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,920
Great! Thank you

183
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,300
Ignite

184
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,630
Five

185
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,090
'Four'

186
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,170
'Three'

187
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,090
'Two'

188
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,630
'One'

189
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,250
Kalaam!

190
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,460
Look! It worked

191
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,420
It didn't work, sir

192
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,050
The vacuum valve was closed

193
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,170
Normal atmospheric pressure
inside the bell jar

194
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,380
Increase the volume!

195
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,630
- Your nose is bleeding
- Hey!

196
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,380
Give me a heads up
so I don't suffer a heart attack!

197
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,840
So 'Deepavali', the festival of lights
in our office once more, eh?

198
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,960
Sir, this morning will be special
with the kind words he blessed us with

199
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,960
Nambi, you seem to have had
your usual breakfast of 'pongal' and 'vada'

200
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,170
With an extra dose
of temerity today?

201
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,880
Sir, you are only paying for the brilliance

202
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,250
Temerity comes free!

203
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,420
I know that only too well

204
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,500
As long as you are here
there's no shortage of temerity!

205
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,340
But if you had shown
even a glimpse of brilliance

206
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,090
By now one of you would have
been in the Ivy League

207
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,300
Our institution has even offered to
cover all expenses magnanimously

208
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,840
The extent of your magnanimity
and magnitude of our talent

209
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,550
...will be known
when the time comes

210
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,340
Dear Lord, wonder when that right time is

211
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,550
Only You know!

212
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,340
Sir, I know it too

213
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,460
You can see for yourself

214
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,630
What's that?

215
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,300
So the rumors are true?

216
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,840
'Where Miss Doubt exists
Truth is her shadow', sir

217
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,630
The proof is in your hands
Read the letter

218
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,050
Nambi

219
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,800
Do you realize what an incredible honor
this is to our institution and our nation?

220
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,840
If it was any other student, by now
he would be floating on air

221
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,880
But this is no big thing
for Mr Nambi, right?

222
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,250
I don't believe doing anything
in small measures, sir

223
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,550
'Why should Nambi go
to Princeton now, sir?'

224
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,630
'I need this man here, sir'

225
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,300
But I just don't understand
his obsession with liquid propulsion, sir

226
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,960
He is fixing selling price of ghee
before buying the cow!

227
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,840
We have barely understood solids
He is jumping to liquids too soon

228
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,670
Sir, let's for a moment forget
when, where and if I'm going anywhere

229
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,420
'Just answer this question'

230
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,420
What are we trying
to achieve here?

231
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,880
What is our current
and end game?

232
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,300
Where is ISRO headed?

233
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,590
Nambi, don't start your sermo-

234
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,090
I'm not sermonizing, Kalam

235
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,500
I'm merely stating facts
Just hear me out

236
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,210
Developing solid first
then liquids and finally cryogenic

237
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,670
Who stipulated this protocol, sir?

238
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,750
We have no choice but treat
these 3 stages as mutually exclusive

239
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,670
Any rocket we build
that does not orbit in Space

240
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,550
...is just a firecracker
on 'Deepavali' night

241
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,460
We need to use these rockets
to launch satellites commercially, sir

242
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,550
In the years to come, we should also
have a share in this trillion dollar market

243
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,250
That's the seat of
prestige and power

244
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,550
Then we never again have to beg
any nation for resources and funds

245
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,550
'That should be our only goal'

246
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,590
ISRO should follow that aim, sir

247
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,880
Because as long as I am here

248
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,500
I will never allow India even in rocketry
to crawl at the pace of a bullock cart

249
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,590
What, Kalam?

250
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,340
Quite a full-fledged sermon actually!

251
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,550
But what he says makes sense, right?

252
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,880
Nambi

253
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,710
I want to clarify a doubt

254
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,090
You have phenomenal faith in liquid fuels

255
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,630
Is it as promising as
you make it out to be?

256
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,460
Isn't the application quite limited?

257
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,380
I knew you would ask me this

258
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,750
Nambi, no...no

259
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,170
According to James,
All World Missile & Rocket Catalog

260
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,170
Almost 19 missiles have already
been powered by liquid fuel

261
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,920
'Now that you have
mentioned missiles to him'

262
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,170
'Now he won't listen
to a single word of mine'

263
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,590
Fine, sir

264
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,880
Guess I have nothing left to say

265
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,130
Nambi, congratulations

266
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,460
ISRO's 1st ever export to the Ivy League!

267
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,550
All the best

268
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,170
Nambi, tell me

269
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,420
You've been given admission into solids

270
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,300
How will you switch to liquids?

271
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,590
Just leave that to me, sir

272
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,630
'Professor Luigi Crocco'

273
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,460
'In the field of theoretical aerodynamics
and rocket propulsion, a revered name'

274
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,130
'His was the best of the brains
behind the Apollo launches'

275
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,050
'If I could just get to do
my thesis under him'

276
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,630
'Definitely we can achieve
our liquid propulsion dreams'

277
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,420
'Come hell, hail or brimstone
I will make this dream come true'

278
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,380
Fluid flows

279
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,170
Now...this is what
we will be discussing today

280
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,550
So this behavioral pattern
inside the shock tube is due to

281
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,710
...the upstream flow of fluids

282
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,750
Downstream, sir

283
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,420
Excuse me

284
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,210
Sir, this behavioral pattern
is only possible

285
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,630
...when the fluid is flowing
downstream in the shock tube

286
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,670
Great!

287
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:56,130
Now we and Ascher Shapiro
have to learn from an Indian rookie

288
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,710
And your name is...?

289
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,170
Sir, my name is Nambi Narayanan

290
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
So, Nambi

291
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,710
Let's say you are right

292
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,340
I am only human

293
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,960
I can make mistakes

294
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,050
But are you saying Ascher Shapiro's
textbook is inaccurate?

295
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,590
Yes, sir, it's inaccurate

296
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,960
Oh! Well, then

297
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,460
Why don't you write to Ascher Shapiro?

298
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,840
Tell him to correct it

299
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,920
According to YOU

300
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,250
He will be very glad
to hear from you, Numbu

301
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,300
Okay, sir

302
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,250
'Maybe I'll just do that'

303
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,750
Thank you for your suggestion!

304
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,630
What's so funny?

305
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Hey Neil

306
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,250
- Hey Neil!
- Sit down, sit down

307
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,250
- How is Janet doing?
- She's fine, thank you for asking

308
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,420
- Good
- Neil, this is Nambi

309
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,960
'A freak who wants to study liquids
under Professor Crocco'

310
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,170
And I would like you
to meet another freak

311
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,500
...who put 3000 tons of
explosives under his ass

312
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,090
Just so he would go
take a piss on the moon!

313
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,050
Sir, it's such an honor to meet you

314
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh! It's an honor to meet you too, Nambi

315
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,670
By the way, Nambi, the old man has
stopped taking any new students

316
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,800
He's right

317
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,090
Professor Crocco rarely comes
to the campus anymore

318
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,420
His wife is really sick
She is bed-ridden actually

319
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,340
Nambi, it's one thing to be under Crocco

320
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,090
It's a whole new deal
getting him to approve your thesis

321
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,130
Take a look at my illustrious friend here

322
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:47,420
A celebrated student of Crocco's
for 8 years and counting

323
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,920
'...who is as cuckoo as Crocco!'

324
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,630
Thank you, you jerk!

325
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,630
Now I need another frigging beer

326
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,210
I'll help you

327
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,250
Excuse me

328
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,420
One more, my friend

329
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,670
I need to go pee

330
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,250
You were quite a hero today at the campus

331
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,500
Did you really end up writing to Shapiro?

332
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,090
Yeah, I actually wrote to him

333
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,340
My name is Yuri

334
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,050
I am an exchange student
from Russia, Aviation Sciences

335
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,130
Nice to meet you

336
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,380
Nice to meet you, Yuri

337
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,460
I'm Nambi

338
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,960
I am into solid fuels as you know,
but I want to shift to liquids

339
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,800
Oh! Really?

340
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,960
Well, if you need any help
just let me know

341
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,250
I will do that

342
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,920
I actually do

343
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,090
Do you know where Professor Crocco lives?

344
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,340
[door bell rings]

345
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,880
[door bell rings]

346
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,130
I'M NOT HOME!

347
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,300
There

348
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,000
Lovely cup of tea

349
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,710
Just a little bit
It's good for you

350
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,210
Just to wet your lips

351
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,630
Okay...good girl

352
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,590
No?

353
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,170
Good morning, sir
My name is Nambi Narayanan

354
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,250
I'm from India

355
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,550
I'm here on a full scholarship
for the solid fuel program

356
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,630
But I want to study desperately
liquid fuels under you

357
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,000
Sir, I've read all your papers

358
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,130
Especially the theory
on the relation between

359
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,380
Thermodynamics and fluid kinematics

360
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,960
What a lovely piece of work, sir

361
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,800
Sir, I've sent you many applications

362
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,920
But I can understand
why you didn't reply to me

363
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,250
Are you serious?

364
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,630
How did you find me?
Who gave you my address?

365
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,800
A Russian...Yuri

366
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,800
You are wasting your time
My hands are full

367
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,880
What you're asking for is impossible

368
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,210
Goodbye!

369
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,550
Sir, you know

370
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,920
For us Indians who have to walk for
2 km to get 3 liters of drinking water

371
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,210
And use it between
the two of us for 3 days!

372
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,630
'Nothing is quite impossible'

373
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,880
What are you doing?

374
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,130
Did you just follow me back in?

375
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,500
Look at you! You brought
the mud into the house

376
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,550
Oh great! Then just another
clean-up job for me

377
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,050
- I don't believe it
- I'm sorry, sir

378
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,340
I don't know who you are
but you have some nerve!

379
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,250
I really don't have the time

380
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,880
You ought to know
I've quit going to the campus

381
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,460
And stopped taking on students

382
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,090
My life is all about her now, okay?

383
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,340
Alright, my darling

384
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,050
Have some breakfast, yes?

385
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,960
'Let's do it'

386
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,170
Sir, I totally understand and
appreciate what you are saying

387
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,500
But please, may I make a suggestion?

388
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,800
Sir, you don't have to
leave the house at all

389
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,170
I will take care of
all your household duties

390
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,050
Indians are very good at that, sir

391
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,090
Sir, I'll do your shopping for you
I'll buy your provisions for you

392
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,130
I will take care of the garden and
wash the utensils and the clothes

393
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,210
And on top of that
I'll clean the house

394
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,920
You know that way you'll get
some quality time with ma'am and-

395
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,210
In your spare time you could
help me with my thesis, sir

396
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,800
It's a win-win for both of us

397
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,300
And I make the world's best omelets!

398
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,550
Nambi, how did it go
with Professor Crocco?

399
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,000
- Are you on?
- I am so on!

400
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,420
That's great!

401
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,880
By the way, can you help me
with these stability configurations?

402
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,250
Sure, no problem

403
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,000
But I need something in return

404
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,420
Can you teach me
how to make an omelet?!

405
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,590
Nambi, I'll get Ken and Beth
to take you through

406
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,550
...at the liquid test facility
to configure the parameters

407
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,880
Okay, sir

408
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,090
'Dear Mr Nambi Narayanan'

409
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,170
Thank you very much for your letter

410
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:41,630
You are the first one to point out
the printing and syntax error in my theorem

411
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,210
In this version of the book

412
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,460
I am surprised that it went unnoticed
by the professors thus far!

413
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,880
But all the same
I assure you it will be corrected

414
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,460
Thank you for pointing it out
and I wish you all the very best

415
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,880
In your future endeavors

416
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,590
Mr...Numbu!

417
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,250
From Ascher Shapiro

418
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,630
You have a lovely day, sir

419
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,840
Hey, sleeping beauty!

420
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Hi!

421
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,670
Haven't seen you guys for a while

422
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,250
All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy

423
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,800
Who is Jack?

424
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,420
Are you serious?

425
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,210
You know when you laugh
you remind me of my son

426
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,920
His eyes also start smiling
before his face does

427
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,380
Exactly like yours

428
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,210
I have no idea you are married

429
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,630
Yes, you see in India it's very difficult
to have a son without a wife!

430
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,250
'Of course'

431
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,840
I think it is incredible
what these guys have achieved

432
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,250
Forget the moon! At this rate
we will be orbiting Pluto in no time

433
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:57,460
I never thought a specific impulse
of 435 was even possible

434
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,380
- Correct
- The Russians are done for!

435
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,920
All they can do now is drown
in their own fine vodka

436
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,050
Right, guys, we are going to split now

437
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,130
- See you later at the bar
- Okay, bye

438
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,170
What happened to you?

439
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,590
They were just joking

440
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,800
Yankee dickheads!

441
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,090
Getting frisky over 435

442
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,800
Poor bastards are going
to lose their hard-on

443
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,090
...when they come to know
about the KVD-1 engines

444
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,210
252 of them

445
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,630
With the specific impulse
of 4 fucking 61!

446
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,130
Just lying there in our facility

447
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,590
As far as interplanetary travel is concerned

448
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,710
Americans have no clue
what's in store for them

449
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,920
Seriously?

450
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,880
A specific impulse of 461?

451
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,550
You're kidding, right?

452
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,590
Right

453
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,550
Forget I said anything

454
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,710
Hey, Yuri

455
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,050
Yuri

456
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,500
Yuri, listen

457
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,960
Can I ask you something?

458
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,500
Are you really
just an exchange student?

459
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,800
Are you here only for Avionics?

460
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,840
[Russian] Yesli ya skazhu

461
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,170
Ty umresh'

462
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,420
I ya umru

463
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,340
What does that mean?

464
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,750
If I tell you

465
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,130
You will die

466
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,380
And I will die!

467
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,170
Let's get some coffee, Nambi

468
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,340
So she's saying that-

469
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,840
You can go back to the University

470
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,380
She's done with you, she is
swapping you for an Indian husband!

471
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,460
Don't push it

472
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,090
Sicilians are very jealous people

473
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,130
In the 4 years since her stroke

474
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,500
She has never smiled

475
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,000
Well! You are welcome

476
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,420
But you know,
we Indian husbands are like that

477
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,210
We always make our woman smile

478
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,090
You know about our population, right?

479
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,210
Meena...?

480
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,500
Aiyo! Sorry, I fell asleep

481
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,840
- Where are you going?
- Did you just come in or going out?

482
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,420
Shall I make coffee for you or-

483
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,590
How is Shankar?

484
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,250
Do you remember you have a son?

485
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,750
Of course I do and
I remember a lot more

486
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,250
How was your flight?

487
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,170
Our very first imaginary story!

488
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,170
'Isn't this Superman animated cartoon'

489
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,550
'A really thrilling clash?'

490
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,380
Sir...sir...?

491
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,500
What if we introduce
a reverse shock wave

492
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,300
...into the active combustion chamber
of the engine to determine instability?

493
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,170
'Sir, this can help us fix'

494
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,380
'...the stability problem
in the Moon Rover as well'

495
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,920
'What do you think?'

496
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,460
'So what we do is'

497
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,960
We introduce a controlled instability in
the active combustion chamber of the engine

498
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,170
'In the form of a reverse shock wave'

499
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,750
'And observe that wave
before instability sets in'

500
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,000
- Right
- Let me explain how that is done

501
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,210
We have the pressure inside the active
combustion chamber which is P1

502
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,210
We separate that with another chamber

503
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,090
With an inert inactive gas
and put that as P2

504
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,710
'...which is at a slightly higher pressure
than the active combustion chamber'

505
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,250
And we separate
the 2 chambers with a membrane

506
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,840
'Now...when you start ignition'

507
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,300
The flames will come,
burn the membrane

508
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,710
And therefore the higher pressure from P2

509
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,670
'...will move into the active
combustion chamber'

510
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,750
'If the engine becomes unstable'

511
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,920
'Then we know that the stability margin'

512
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,090
'...is between P1 and P2'

513
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,710
'But if the engine can handle that'

514
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,250
'We know that we have to
increase the pressure in P2'

515
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,090
'And keep doing that
till instability sets in'

516
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,840
Brilliant! But that would be
an insane amount of variables

517
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,300
Insane, yes

518
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,630
But impossible, no

519
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:10,300
'And it's much better than blowing up
actual engines before we get it right'

520
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,920
'Impressive!'

521
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,920
'Now this is a breach of rules'

522
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,960
You are supposed to be here for 3 years
And you've only done 10 months

523
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,340
Sorry, I can't let you go

524
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,840
Here

525
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,170
My dear, I have some bad news

526
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,800
You've just lost your Indian husband!

527
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,170
And we, our domestic help

528
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,460
O' Mother Goddess!

529
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,550
Go

530
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,420
I'm going to miss you so much

531
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,170
You take care of yourself, okay?

532
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,920
Thank you

533
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,170
'This is Crocco'

534
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,420
Get me Eugene Scott

535
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,800
There you are

536
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,250
'This ought to be
a 'dream come true' for you'

537
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,300
'I suppose you must be very good'

538
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,460
Because it is not that often
Crocco recommends a student!

539
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,880
Thank you so much

540
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,340
And it's such a pleasure
to meet you, Mr Scott

541
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,670
But I must tell you,
Mr Nambi Narayanan

542
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,420
That you are in for some
real hard work and dedication

543
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,670
Your commit has to be absolute

544
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,880
- Yes, sir
- Come

545
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,170
- Everyone has been so excited
- I'm sure

546
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,420
This is a very interesting phase
of our exploration

547
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,800
Let me introduce you to someone

548
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,130
A brilliant mind and
a fellow American, mind you

549
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,250
Barry, this is Nambi
Nambi, this is Barry

550
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,130
- Hello
- Barry Amaldev

551
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,050
All the best
Barry, take over

552
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:09,000
- I'll see you around here
- Okay, bye

553
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,380
I knew you were coming in today

554
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,090
And I figured you must be missing
your filter coffee from back home!

555
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,710
- So much!
- I made you some

556
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,840
Well, my wife made you some

557
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Enjoy

558
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,960
Oh my god!

559
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,340
'Amme Bhagavati'

560
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,300
This is reminding me of home so much

561
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,250
- I bet it does
- Yeah

562
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,050
You know, getting a NASA fellowship
in 3 months is pretty big by itself

563
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,800
- Thank you
- On top of that

564
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,960
I have never heard Professor Crocco
ever recommending a student to work here

565
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,670
You must be the real deal, Nambi!

566
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,920
Well, it's quite the privilege
and as is this coffee

567
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,920
But you know the...fellowship money helps

568
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,170
I am sure it does

569
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,460
It's going to be a privilege
to work with you, Nambi

570
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,590
For a man with talents like yours
you are in the right place

571
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,960
Thank you so much

572
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,670
'NASA's offer is too good to be true'

573
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,750
Isn't it a fantastic deal?

574
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,670
At least now do you realize
your husband's true worth?

575
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:10,380
The salary my father, maternal uncle,
paternal uncle, my whole family

576
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,500
...can earn in 5 years

577
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,550
Will you get in just 1 year?

578
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
No

579
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,420
In 1 month!

580
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,460
Whaaat?!

581
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,710
What do you say?

582
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,170
Want to settle down here?

583
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,960
Shall I accept NASA's offer?

584
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,960
If you can't notice a cow in broad daylight
what is the use of being able to see?

585
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,300
How can you lose
such a golden opportunity-

586
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,460
'Hey Nambi'

587
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
'Hi Meena'

588
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,250
Hi Elizabeth, still with the solids?

589
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,590
Yeah, but I can't wait
to get into liquids with you!

590
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,590
Let's go back to India

591
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,090
- Huh?
- Yes

592
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,380
We can't burst crackers here
to celebrate 'Deepavali'

593
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,460
Or decorate our porch with 'rangoli'
for 'Pongal', India is any day better

594
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,170
Is that so? Look at me and
tell me that's the only reason

595
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,170
- Look into my eyes
- Let's go back

596
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,170
You mean it?
Why this change of mind?

597
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,380
- Tell me...real reason
- Let's go back to India

598
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,550
'Bastards!'

599
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,050
They are trying to poach
my best scientist again

600
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,670
Nambi is very special to us, Satish

601
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,090
You are right, sir

602
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,710
We can't afford to lose him
for any reason whatsoever

603
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,920
I think I should speak to him

604
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,500
Call him

605
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,590
- 'Hello...?'
- I truly understand, Nambi

606
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,840
This is a lucrative offer way beyond
the imagination of any Indian scientist

607
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,300
This is NASA, Mr Nambi

608
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:30,130
The most coveted playground
for any scientist worth his salt

609
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,300
I trust you understand
what an honor this is!

610
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,630
It's true

611
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,130
Also

612
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,340
Compared to the salary
they are willing to pay you

613
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,300
What we are offering is peanuts

614
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,340
I understand

615
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,630
And doesn't stop
with a generous pay check

616
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,130
There's a high end vehicle

617
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:49,130
Housing allowance and an annual
paid vacation for you and the family

618
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,340
Nambi

619
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,840
You are an extraordinary scientist

620
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,710
No doubt whatsoever

621
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,460
And I respect that

622
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,960
So whatever decision you take
I will accept it wholeheartedly

623
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,420
Presidential offer would
be the final formality

624
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,210
And you should have it in 2 days

625
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,300
'Nobody ever refuses
the President, Mr Nambi'

626
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,420
'Take your time'

627
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,130
I know

628
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,590
It's a tough call

629
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,000
Tough...my foot!

630
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,590
I have only one answer to
the question, 'ISRO or NASA?'

631
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,550
He said I couldn't refuse
the Presidential offer

632
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,050
So I just ended up refusing him!

633
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,670
Welcome back, my blue-eyed Princetonian

634
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,710
'Nambi'

635
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,300
I insist you continue your research
in liquid fuel propulsion

636
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,500
Go around the world to
all the liquid test facilities

637
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,300
And study their progress

638
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,170
'And stay updated'

639
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,960
Only then, when we get
the required funds

640
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,750
...we don't have to be digging for data

641
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,420
I agree but-

642
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,670
NASA is out of question now

643
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,590
Russians and Chinese won't allow
even a fly into their facility

644
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,880
That leaves Europe

645
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,420
What is sir waiting for?

646
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,380
'I'm so glad to see you, Nambi'

647
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,460
'I feel like I have a little bit
of India here with me'

648
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,380
'Yeah, there was one night in Bombay'

649
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,380
'I was relishing
the local food on the beach'

650
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,630
'Good on the eyes
Great on the palate'

651
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,960
By the end of the night, I didn't know
from which end I was whistling louder

652
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,800
And when I was a colonel in the city,
I got to meet Jamshed Tata

653
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,300
I mean what a visionary that man was!

654
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,210
That man gave India
her 1st computer center

655
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,750
3 years ago

656
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,500
I'm so impressed
that you know about all this

657
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,300
Most people in India are not aware!

658
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,380
'It was our mistake, back then'

659
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,000
'Breaking you up into India, Pakistan'

660
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,000
What do you know?
The Domino effect goes on

661
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,300
Now you've got Bangladesh

662
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,000
Oh! I'm...I'm sorry

663
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,300
Am I hogging the conversation?

664
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,800
Yes, my love, you are

665
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,750
Sorry, India does that to him!

666
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,710
Oh! There's no need
for apologies, Mrs Cleaver

667
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,460
I think it's quite a compliment

668
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,920
You are very sweet, sir

669
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,050
Okay

670
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,170
Okay then, enough...enough about me

671
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,960
Why are you interested in
the Rolls Royce hydraulic systems?

672
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,800
Sir, India is at a very nascent stage
of rocketry and we can't afford

673
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,590
...the kind of technology we need

674
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:47,880
'We heard so much about
your equipment and the plant'

675
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,670
'At the Rolls Royce hydraulic factory
I just had to see it for myself'

676
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,630
'Sir, I was in France
just a month ago'

677
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,840
'And we were just content
reading about the hydraulic systems'

678
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,550
'And now, I'm here'

679
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,000
'Seeing the testing of fluids with
such complex system of gauges'

680
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,420
'This is incredible!'

681
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,420
As is this food
Thank you so much for it

682
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,840
You are very kind

683
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,880
We really wish you could
have stayed for New Year

684
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,000
Food and extra day's stay are luxuries
that ISRO can ill-afford right now

685
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,750
So how long was your tenure in India?

686
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,710
Well, it was long enough

687
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,130
...for the imperialist guilt to
weigh heavy upon my heart!

688
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,000
I've often wished there was
something I could do

689
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,250
...in my own small way to make amends!

690
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,500
I don't know about then

691
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,050
But I do know of a way now

692
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,800
Colonel Cleaver

693
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,800
It's a well-known fact

694
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,300
...that European rocketry
program is on a slow burn

695
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,800
Because the U.S is undertaking
all your rocketry responsibilities

696
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:57,630
Which also means that the hydraulic plant
and all the equipment I saw today

697
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,300
...will all be rendered
useless and dysfunctional

698
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,960
Because you'll have to move the plant

699
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,550
And what a tragedy that will be!

700
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,170
But what is the setback for you

701
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,550
...could transcend 10 years
of research for us in India

702
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,550
So I want to make an outrageous request

703
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:17,420
Give us the hydraulic plant
and all the equipment

704
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,050
'I know as a nation'

705
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,710
We can't afford
to pay you a dime

706
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,880
But we will forever be indebted to you!

707
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,340
You do know what you are asking for is

708
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,750
400 million pounds
worth of equipment

709
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,750
Even as I said it, I realized
how ridiculous I sounded

710
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,920
I'm so sorry

711
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,000
Please forget I asked

712
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,380
On the other hand, darling

713
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,500
He isn't asking for the Kohinoor!

714
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,550
Oh!

715
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,460
The lights are out

716
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,590
Come

717
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,920
You will enjoy this

718
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,050
Excuse me

719
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,210
This is so spectacular

720
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,710
I've never seen something like this

721
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,920
It is indeed an outrageous request

722
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:24,170
I'm surprised you had
the audacity to ask

723
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,880
Though it's not a remotely
worthy compensation, Nambi

724
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,130
It will be an honor to give you
all the equipment for free

725
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,710
As is in with my power to grant

726
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,550
Now what's not within my power is
bearing the cost of shipping it to India

727
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,550
Much though I would like to oblige

728
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,670
You must make those arrangements

729
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,920
My dear boy

730
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,340
I don't know what to say

731
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,800
This is spectacular
This is wonderful news

732
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,960
Oh! Save it, Nambi

733
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,670
It was probably built
from money procured from India!

734
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:04,250
You know this is such wonderful news

735
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,590
I can't wait to tell Vikram sir about it

736
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:09,210
Why don't you give him a call?
Give the old man a ring right now

737
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:11,170
I think it's very late at night there

738
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm leaving by the early morning flight

739
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,000
I would like to see his face in person
when I tell him this wonderful news

740
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,250
But thank you so much

741
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,500
'Thank you'

742
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:25,960
£400 million worth of equipment for free?!

743
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,630
I can't believe it, man

744
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,130
- It's amazing!
- Sir

745
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,710
I don't believe doing anything
in small measures!

746
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,500
On a serious note, Nambi

747
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,920
You know, your obsession,
your passion, perseverance

748
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,800
Your anger, your impatience may
one day dangle like a sword of Damocles!

749
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:48,130
But these very same qualities
will place a crown over your head too

750
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,090
Whatever happens
don't ever relinquish your vision

751
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,960
I'll be there for you
every step of the way

752
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,920
'Prominent Indian scientist
Dr Vikram A Sarabhai'

753
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,670
'Chairman of Indian Space
Research Organization'

754
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:04,670
'As well as the Atomic Energy body
was found dead at Kovalam Palace'

755
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:08,000
'A Govt tourist hotel
in the Southern state of Kerala'

756
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,710
'He was 52 years old'

757
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,000
'Dr Sarabhai'

758
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:13,130
'Son of a textile millionaire
and friend of the-'

759
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,550
'Flight 147 from London to Trivandrum
will be landing in 25 minutes'

760
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,670
'Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival'

761
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,250
Sarabhai's death was not only
a setback for Indian Space Research

762
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,550
It must have entrapped you
in a huge void too

763
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,960
You stood forlorn, losing your mentor

764
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,340
To find another cheerleader
like Sarabhai to trust you blindfolded

765
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,210
To support your crazy, lofty dreams

766
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:46,460
It would have been really tough
to find a replacement in ISRO

767
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:49,460
Mr Satish Dhawan

768
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,670
Vowed to support you
in every which way

769
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,340
He promised Sarabhai

770
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,340
Did he keep up his word?

771
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,960
After Vikram Sarabhai's demise

772
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,460
I could no longer be the privileged one
at ISRO, showing off my temerity

773
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,800
I found a good friend
and guide in Satish sir

774
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,800
But even that was
a tiring relationship

775
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,880
Because I had decided to build
a liquid fuel engine on my own

776
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:23,840
His lack of resources and my impatience
proved to be an explosive combination

777
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:27,340
'What have you done
for the impurities in the water?'

778
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,750
- We've installed a filter
- Guys, this is muddy water

779
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,710
The mud will get deposited in the filter

780
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,000
If that happens?

781
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,130
- As time progresses
- Calibration will keep varying

782
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,920
'Five-four-three-'

783
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,420
- This is about to explode
- 'Two-one'

784
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,710
Stop it-

785
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:56,840
'Nambi, would you
like a cup of tea?'

786
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:01,130
Looks like only this hot tea
listens to your ideas!

787
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,050
Sir, is everyone jobless
in the fabrication department?

788
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,050
All they do is flash their teeth!

789
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,920
Get lost, man!

790
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:14,590
Sir, if you cannot provide me
with effective and decent resources

791
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:17,710
Please accept my resignation
because I cannot work like this

792
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,840
- Calm down, Nambi, relax
- How can I relax, sir?

793
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,460
Everybody is blaming me for
the failure of the liquid fuel engine

794
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,960
But the truth of the matter is
I failed because of you!

795
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,050
Are you done?

796
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,880
I know you are being 'drama king'
because of a bee in your bonnet

797
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,670
Be upfront about what you want to say

798
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,960
Sir, the world is making
60-70 tonne engines

799
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,550
We are crawling on the ground
with 600 kg toy cars!

800
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,460
It isn't rocketry, sir
This is puppetry

801
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,460
Nambi, beggars can't throw banquets!

802
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,340
Tell me what we can do
with the limited budget in our hands

803
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,380
Our budget may be strained
Is there any constraint on our brains?

804
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,710
Time to sell our brilliant minds
to convert loss into gain

805
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,170
What are you trying to say?

806
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:54,630
Sir

807
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,920
For their Ariane rockets, SEP in France
is developing Viking, a liquid fuel engine

808
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,840
It's a mega project that requires
100s of scientists and man years

809
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,840
We offer them our mental manpower

810
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,340
And in the process, first hand pick up
their technology for liquid fuel engines

811
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,380
It's a barter

812
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:17,800
But are the French our uncles
or brothers-in-law to agree to this?

813
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,420
Sir, it's okay if they don't agree
But what if they do?

814
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,800
If they agree, am I an idiot
to stand in the way?

815
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,050
You have my hearty blessings

816
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,130
In that case, sir, please sign
your blessings on this contract

817
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,090
I've already spoken to the French

818
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,130
We have a deal

819
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,250
But this is a bloody good deal!

820
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,880
So what else do you need?

821
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,800
Learn French and be willing to live
in France with their families for 3 years

822
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,750
52 scientists who are prepared
to put their nose to the grindstone

823
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,300
'8 months to learn French?'

824
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,920
'This is not rocket science'

825
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,670
Nambi, it took me 8 years to learn English!

826
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:53,710
I like that!

827
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:54,920
Good...now

828
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,250
How do you say
'Good morning' in French?

829
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,630
Bonjour

830
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:59,750
Correct

831
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:05,000
If any of us speaks a word
of French while we are in France

832
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,920
Then we will all lose our jobs

833
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,420
And be sent back to India
with a hole in our pocket!

834
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,920
How would you say this in French?

835
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,840
That's right

836
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,050
When we are in France

837
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,750
Zip your lips

838
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,710
Keep only your eyes and ears open

839
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,210
No one should know that we know French

840
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:28,710
'Gentlemen'

841
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,340
There is more to this mission
than meets the eye

842
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,300
It may seem ordinary
but we have a lot to achieve

843
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:36,170
I hope all of you have read
the project report

844
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,670
And memorized the objectives

845
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,340
'In order to build
our own liquid engine'

846
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,880
'First we need to understand
the intricacies of their engine'

847
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,250
While in France

848
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:53,170
We will do our best to rotate
everyone of you in all the departments

849
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,500
'Gentlemen'

850
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:59,380
'Vernon is a very small town in France
where everybody knows everybody'

851
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,920
'We have to be very careful'

852
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,590
'We already have our people
in these departments'

853
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,800
Tank gauges, pressurization systems

854
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,750
Control elements
Thrust chamber assembly

855
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,210
But we need to fill
our people into regulators

856
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:23,800
Stage systems

857
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,800
Gimbal actuator systems and
mainly command module systems

858
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,630
We need to figure out how to
turn these reds into greens

859
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:34,000
Nambi, many tests are being
aborted half way through

860
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:37,170
[Malayalam] We don't know whether
it is because of the pressure variation

861
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:40,050
Or if it is the malfunction of
the pressure gauging senses

862
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:44,920
Nambi, we need the analysis and end data of
these test failures to find out the reason

863
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,670
And there's only one place
where we can find all of this

864
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,750
- R-C-D
- Bloody deal!

865
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:54,300
RCD is one place they don't even
let us walk past, forget about getting in

866
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,210
I don't know how you
will manage this, Nambi

867
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:01,880
Because we need to know what is being
discussed in RCD for our know-why

868
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:03,590
Otherwise our mission is kaput

869
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,880
Enough, don't keep repeating it
like a broken record

870
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,880
'Nambi'

871
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,170
Remember what the French taught us
when we visited the Monet museum

872
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,750
Take a few steps back and look
at the painting from a distance

873
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,800
Only then we can
appreciate its true beauty

874
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:30,420
Yes, but what does that have to do
with our discussion right now?

875
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,750
Nambi

876
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:38,340
Viking engine has got
a low upper stability margin

877
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,340
- What are you saying?
- Yeah

878
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:50,920
The system is designed to have
an operating pressure of 52.6 bars

879
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,420
A system like this should
have a stability margin

880
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,300
...of at least 5 bars more than that

881
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,090
How much can the Viking handle?

882
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,840
Like if the pressure goes up by even 2 bars

883
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,710
When I set eyes on a beautiful girl

884
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,420
And go gaga over her

885
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,090
Viking will vibrate faster than me

886
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,710
'Height of self respect!
He takes a royal dig at himself'

887
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,590
- Nambi
- Hey!

888
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:30,380
- Let me introduce you to-
- Hey!

889
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,550
Barry! How are you doing?

890
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,170
- Good to see you, man
- You jerk!

891
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,750
After all that filter coffee last time

892
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,800
You couldn't bother to say
a proper goodbye, huh?

893
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,800
I'm so sorry-

894
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,210
He is part of the advisory
committee for the Viking engine

895
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,130
Oh! He is part of
the advisory committee?

896
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:45,420
Guys, this is Barry
He is from the U.S

897
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,630
Part of the advisory committee
for the Viking engine

898
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:48,750
Oh! Congrats, man

899
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,250
Hey, so how come
you didn't tell them

900
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,210
...that the upper stability margin
of the Viking engine is so low, huh?

901
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,500
I think the alcohol is getting to him

902
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:57,800
Okay, I tried telling you

903
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,880
I promise I won't say
'I told you so' later on

904
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,710
So tell me, how long have you been here?

905
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:02,880
Ah, not for long

906
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,880
Just here to observe
and assist if necessary

907
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,050
Are you assisting? Good

908
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,000
What were you saying
about the stability margin?

909
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,130
Michelle, I was saying that the-

910
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,670
Upper stability margin of
the Viking engine is a little too low

911
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,340
A little bit of change in
the operating pressure and the engine

912
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,590
...will vibrate or worse still
totally explode!

913
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,920
No...no, that's not possible

914
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,210
Actually it's quite possible
because you are assuming

915
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,550
That your fuel is as pure
as the French wine!

916
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:28,550
But if it turns out to be
a cheap American knock-off

917
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:31,460
The engine will be drunk
before you can say 'santé'

918
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,340
Is that your Indian sense of humor?

919
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,840
What if I prove it to you?

920
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:47,130
- Shall we begin?
- Yes

921
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:48,590
Param, start

922
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:03,710
Perfect!

923
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:04,750
Smooth running

924
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,050
That will be the operating pressure
we designed it to be

925
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:09,960
Yes, but what about
the stability margin, huh?

926
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,380
Param

927
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,880
Increase

928
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,920
Stop it
Stop the engine!

929
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,960
Hey! But an engine like this should be
able to withstand this easily, huh?

930
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,800
Without a reasonable stability margin

931
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,800
...you are vulnerable to
high risk failures, guys

932
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,550
Param, some more

933
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,210
Nambi

934
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,670
- You see my point?
- Yes

935
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:44,460
Yes...yes, stop the engine

936
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,210
If that stand explodes,
it will cost us a million pounds!

937
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,460
It won't explode now

938
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,090
Another 0.2 bars and then
the fireworks will begin!

939
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:54,000
Engine is giving our expert belly dancer
a complex about her hip-shake!

940
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,340
Param, increase it

941
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:02,630
Stop! Stop the engine please

942
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:04,000
Param...Param...Param

943
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,050
'Stop...stop'

944
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:15,210
Michelle, I've done this before

945
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:17,710
The Ariane deserves
a much more reliable engine

946
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,590
I know that you have placed orders
for the mass production of the spare parts

947
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,960
But if I were you, I would think twice
before putting my name on those contracts

948
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:27,170
But the rest is up to you

949
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,130
Hey! Come on, guys, let's go

950
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,960
Poor thing! That girl is even more
shaken than the engine!

951
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:47,670
I know you long enough to know that
you are obviously doing this for a reason

952
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,210
But I don't know what it is

953
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,420
So I have to fall
in the trap and ask you

954
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:52,960
Can you fix this?

955
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:57,590
God's sake, Nambi

956
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,460
This is 'yes'

957
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,210
And this is 'no'

958
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,000
What does this mean?

959
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:05,090
[French] Thank God!
Someone finally asked

960
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,000
Yes...yes, I think I can do it

961
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,750
But I need all the information and data
on the test failures to be able to do that

962
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,210
[whispering]

963
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,670
The one place where
all the relevant information

964
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:27,670
...can be given to you is the RCD

965
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:30,130
Would you be able to
make time for those meetings?

966
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,420
Yes, I guess I can do that

967
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,130
But, Michelle,
my schedule is very packed

968
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:37,210
Very busy

969
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:38,800
We'll work around your schedule

970
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,710
What happened, Param?

971
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:46,670
I think what you can do is rotate
all my men in all the departments

972
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,880
So that they can fill in for me
when I am at the RCD

973
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,130
Easily done

974
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,550
The committee meets tomorrow at 9

975
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,920
But, Nambi, all I have is
about 60 days to fix this

976
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,590
Can you do it?

977
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,210
Yes, yes, yes!
Yes, I can

978
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,550
- I can try to fix it
- Thank you

979
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:19,340
I've heard of a mountain
being dragged by a strand of hair

980
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,800
But you accomplished
this Herculean task, Nambi

981
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,670
Okay, you managed to get inside RCD

982
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:26,550
How will you increase the stability margin
of that damn Viking engine?

983
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,590
Hail Professor Crocco!

984
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:35,300
I swear!

985
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,340
Devious wiz!

986
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,670
You've already solved it, right?

987
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,420
The problem is in the orifice

988
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,460
All we have to do is increase
the diameter of the injector passage

989
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:48,050
And the stability margin will shoot up

990
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:51,590
Nambi, you are THE man

991
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:56,000
Thank you, but there is only one guy
who can do this precise job

992
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,130
- Our man Unni?
- That's right

993
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,590
We have to bring him here
at the earliest and finish the job

994
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:02,460
Only then everything
will be within our circle

995
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,380
Nambi, we are talking about ISRO

996
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,380
He will be here in
a year or two, if we rush it!

997
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,250
He has to come here
within 15 days

998
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,500
We have no other option

999
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:13,590
We won't get a better opportunity
to finish this mission victoriously

1000
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,840
'Sir, the ruckus you created
to get me here'

1001
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,840
Like smearing the bull's butt
with 'chunam' paste

1002
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,500
...to make it run faster in a rekla race

1003
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,500
ISRO created history
driving me up the wall, sir

1004
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,590
Given the chance

1005
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:34,550
The Governor would have dropped me
bag and baggage at the airport

1006
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,800
So you understand how important
your work here is, in France, Unni?

1007
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,000
- Yes, sir
- The whole mission depends on you

1008
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,000
How's everyone at home, Unni?

1009
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:43,710
Fine, sir

1010
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,670
My son wasn't keeping very well

1011
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:47,460
- Aiyo!
- But he's fine now

1012
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,550
I told my wife I'm going
to France and she said

1013
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,750
'He who can't catch the rooster on the roof
claims he's catching a glimpse of paradise'

1014
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,500
On my way back, she asked me
to buy 1/2 kg onions, sir

1015
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:02,460
So are you ready to
take on the French, Unni?

1016
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,250
The lime paste has already
been smeared on my butt, sir!

1017
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,710
Just watch me sprint!

1018
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,090
That's my man!

1019
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:42,340
'Nambi, call for you on line #3'

1020
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,340
Hello?

1021
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,800
'Unni...?'

1022
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,210
'Can I talk to Unni?'

1023
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,630
'I have been trying to
reach him for a long time'

1024
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:51,840
Sorry, Unni is not here

1025
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,630
I am Nambi Narayanan here

1026
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:55,000
Can I take any message?

1027
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,630
Oh! Nambi sir...Nambi sir

1028
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:58,550
I am Unni's father-in-law speaking

1029
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,750
'I have been trying to reach him
in this # for the past 2 days'

1030
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:04,250
'The most tragic event has befallen us'

1031
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,500
'Unni's 3 year old son'

1032
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:07,880
'...has passed away, sir'

1033
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,090
O' Mother Goddess!

1034
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:12,750
'We are waiting for him'

1035
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,300
Please send Unni home
as soon as possible, sir

1036
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,300
His wife is heart broken
and inconsolable

1037
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,550
Nambi sir?

1038
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,670
'Nambi sir?'

1039
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,960
Sir, I am at a loss for words
I don't know what to do

1040
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,050
'I know this is the most
unbearable tragedy for you'

1041
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,670
But there's a hitch, sir

1042
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:38,630
It will take at least 15 days
for Unni to reach Trivandrum

1043
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:40,300
Why, sir?

1044
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,380
'Sir, try to understand
what I'm about to tell you'

1045
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,590
Even if I move heaven and earth

1046
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:48,920
...to organize Unni's papers and tickets
for him to fly will take minimum 4-5 days

1047
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:52,250
By which time you would have
finished all the rites

1048
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:56,710
Instead if Unni stayed here for 8 days
and completed his task

1049
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,340
We will be able to complete
a key project of our mission, sir

1050
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:02,710
He is indispensable to us now

1051
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,380
This will be a great service
on his part to our motherland, sir

1052
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,210
So I request you to allow-

1053
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,380
'Whaat?!'

1054
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,880
'Are you mad or what?'

1055
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,380
Didn't you hear a word
of what I just told you?

1056
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,420
His one and only son is dead, sir

1057
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:17,590
Sir...sir

1058
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
You don't have to give me
an answer right now

1059
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,880
I understand your trauma, sir

1060
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,840
I'll call you in a short while

1061
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,340
'Consult your daughter and
let me know your decision, sir'

1062
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,420
Thank you, sir

1063
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,170
'Sir, 1 minute'

1064
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:53,130
'Before you tell me your decision
I need to explain something to you'

1065
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:55,880
If Unni leaves now
without completing his task

1066
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:59,340
The blood, sweat and tears of
52 scientists for so many years

1067
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:02,090
ISRO's investment and resources
will go down the drain

1068
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,750
And take many more years
to retrieve our position

1069
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,960
'Sir, wait'

1070
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:08,340
'Don't push me into a moral dilemma'

1071
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,630
'I cannot dream of asking
my daughter to do this'

1072
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:15,800
To the best of my ability

1073
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,380
I will try and...take good care of her

1074
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,500
'You do what you think is best, sir'

1075
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:42,960
Thank you very much, Nambi sir

1076
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
You never let me pay for any of the gifts
I buy for my family or my son

1077
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,250
I feel a bit guilty, sir

1078
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:51,460
Don't worry about all that

1079
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,550
All you have to do is
finish your job

1080
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,050
Sure, sir

1081
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,500
Excellent!

1082
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,960
Unni, you've got a call from home

1083
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,750
Someone from your house
wants to talk to you

1084
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,960
Can't you hear me?
You've got a call from India

1085
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,090
GET IT INTO YOUR HEAD
EMERGENCY CALL FOR YOU

1086
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:57,170
COME

1087
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,420
Nambi-

1088
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:23,670
When?

1089
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:38,210
Unni

1090
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:44,250
Unni

1091
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:53,500
Unni

1092
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:22,800
You knew about this 15 days earlier

1093
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,300
But you didn't tell me

1094
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,300
You saw me buy clothes
and toys for my son

1095
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:35,210
You came shopping with me
and you even paid for it!

1096
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,090
Then-

1097
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:53,800
How is it even possible
for a man to be this inhuman?

1098
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,550
I did everything knowing
fully well what I was doing

1099
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,090
I had no choice, Unni

1100
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:07,000
Even if you had gone back home early
you couldn't have changed anything

1101
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,710
But everything here
would have got ruined

1102
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:16,800
You succeeding in this mission
unfortunately became my cruel duty

1103
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,050
I'm ready to apologize to you

1104
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:22,380
But I know very well
you will not forgive me

1105
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:26,340
No one should be in my shoes, Unni

1106
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:30,460
'But if it did again to me
I will do exactly what I did now'

1107
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,670
What happened?

1108
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:34,920
Unni's son died and
Nambi didn't tell him

1109
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:40,420
Are you done?

1110
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:43,750
Got everything off your chest?

1111
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:45,960
This is not to reconcil-

1112
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,090
I do not want to see your face
ever again in my life

1113
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,550
Unni...Unni!

1114
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,460
- Nambi, why ddi you do this?
- Did I ask you for advice?

1115
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:13,420
And even if I ask you
don't give it to me

1116
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:16,590
I am not here to get
a character certification from you

1117
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:18,250
Or win a popularity contest

1118
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:21,000
We are here on a mission

1119
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:22,840
It's to our credit
if we complete it properly

1120
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:26,130
And if any of you have a problem
you can go back home today

1121
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,500
I can finish this mission
without any of you

1122
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:30,840
Go now

1123
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,550
Get to work

1124
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,000
We don't have time

1125
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:57,710
There isn't much of a difference
between your lie and the truth you hid

1126
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:00,800
You lied

1127
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,130
You hid the truth

1128
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,340
But you did it purely for the welfare of
our nation and development of ISRO

1129
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,840
I can understand that

1130
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,670
But despite all these sacrifices

1131
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:17,500
The first liquid engine
that India made

1132
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,460
...took a very long time, right?

1133
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,170
Nearly 8 years

1134
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,550
Though we went to France and got
a detailed training with their scientists

1135
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:31,090
As usual we didn't have the funds
to build our own liquid engine

1136
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,500
Finally they sanctioned
Rs 1 crore to build 1 engine

1137
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:38,880
I built the engine in 60 lakhs

1138
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,840
'But the test stand required to
test my engine cost nearly 100 crores'

1139
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,960
'1 billion!'

1140
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:49,750
'So we had no choice but to go to France
and test my engines on their test stand'

1141
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:54,250
'Without external help we wanted
ISRO to finally launch its own satellites'

1142
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:57,000
'We knew how important the success
of this engine hinged on it'

1143
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:58,750
'So we were all extremely tense'

1144
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:20,880
- Param, the pressure system's good?
- Good to go

1145
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:30,500
All the best, Nambi

1146
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:31,710
Thanks, Michelle

1147
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:38,340
[French] I have a feeling this will
crash and burn in less than 45 seconds

1148
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:40,670
Of course it will but
the question is, which second?

1149
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:42,630
- Want to bet?
- Yes

1150
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:43,840
42 seconds

1151
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:46,340
I hope everything goes well today

1152
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:48,000
At least our engine should fire

1153
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:50,550
Even though Viking runs for 135 seconds

1154
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:52,210
I'll be happy with at least 90

1155
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,210
Lord, allow it to run for 135 seconds

1156
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:58,630
I'll ensure the 135 scientists in ISRO will
climb up Tirupati and tonsure their heads

1157
01:10:58,670 --> 01:10:59,920
Just 135 seconds

1158
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,130
I'll make 135 kg of 'laddu'
with pure Indian ghee

1159
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:04,000
'Out station, this is Control'

1160
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:05,630
'Weather condition okay'

1161
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:06,960
'Clear to fire'

1162
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:08,590
Roger, copy that

1163
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,050
'Ten'

1164
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:14,710
'Nine'

1165
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,090
'Eight'

1166
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:17,300
'Seven'

1167
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:18,670
'Six'

1168
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,210
'Five'

1169
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:21,750
'Four'

1170
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:23,340
'Three'

1171
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,550
'Two'

1172
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:26,090
'One'

1173
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,210
[praying fervently]

1174
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,710
106-107-108

1175
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:02,800
Hundred and-

1176
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,500
130-131-132

1177
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:28,300
133-134

1178
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:56,840
Thank you
Thank you so much

1179
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,800
You should congratulate Nambi
It's his birthday as well

1180
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:35,630
Thank you
Congratulations

1181
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,130
My God!

1182
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:48,590
My God! What have you done, Nambi?
I'm so proud and happy for you!

1183
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:50,300
Thank you

1184
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:58,050
For all those back home who thought
we are here for the wine and women

1185
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:59,880
This is a tight slap on all their faces

1186
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,960
You have proven them wrong
Nambi Narayanan can be trusted to deliver

1187
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,420
You are the man!

1188
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:11,210
VIKAS! It is a strange name for an engine

1189
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:13,550
So is Vikram A Sarabhai

1190
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:16,300
Nambi, I have to fulfil my vow
of tonsuring the heads of 135-

1191
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:17,670
Vik-A-S

1192
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,750
Trust you to come up
with such an apt name!

1193
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:26,500
[French] Thank you so much
for your assistance

1194
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:29,500
This would never have been
possible without all of you

1195
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:32,590
Thank you

1196
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:42,050
Did he just rattle in French?

1197
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:43,500
He did indeed

1198
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,300
Very fluent French, in fact!

1199
01:18:12,297 --> 01:18:16,167
Vikas engine was a noteworthy
turning point for ISRO

1200
01:18:16,627 --> 01:18:18,127
Even after 25 years

1201
01:18:18,457 --> 01:18:20,417
Vikas engine has not failed even once

1202
01:18:20,877 --> 01:18:22,877
ISRO's magnificent achievement

1203
01:18:23,377 --> 01:18:25,297
Launches and missions
might have failed

1204
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:27,047
But Vikas engine

1205
01:18:27,087 --> 01:18:28,127
Not once

1206
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:31,087
Not even once has it failed till date

1207
01:18:31,587 --> 01:18:35,667
None of ISRO's significant missions will
travel in space without our Vikas engine

1208
01:18:36,007 --> 01:18:39,417
This is a truth that cannot be
concealed or contradicted by anyone

1209
01:18:41,707 --> 01:18:43,627
What an astounding achievement, sir

1210
01:18:44,547 --> 01:18:45,667
Thank you

1211
01:18:46,207 --> 01:18:48,127
But you don't do anything
in half measures

1212
01:18:48,167 --> 01:18:49,377
Then your next aim

1213
01:18:50,837 --> 01:18:52,207
Cryogenic engines

1214
01:18:52,457 --> 01:18:56,587
Yes, despite the number of solid
and liquid fuel engines we had

1215
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,127
Without cryogenics stage

1216
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:02,297
...in the satellite launch market
we wouldn't have made a name for ourselves

1217
01:19:03,087 --> 01:19:07,417
At that time I was the head
Chief of Cryogenic Unit

1218
01:19:07,797 --> 01:19:11,087
We didn't have the time
to make a cryogenic engine

1219
01:19:11,257 --> 01:19:14,917
'Deciding to import the technology
from other countries, we issued tenders'

1220
01:19:15,377 --> 01:19:18,207
And in this 'groom matching' quest
all the expected countries applied

1221
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:23,457
'American and French offers
weren't feasible for us'

1222
01:19:24,047 --> 01:19:25,377
'On the other hand'

1223
01:19:25,457 --> 01:19:27,337
'Russian economy was drowning'

1224
01:19:28,087 --> 01:19:32,797
'And on that drowning ship was an engine
that I was very familiar with'

1225
01:19:35,297 --> 01:19:36,587
The KVD-1 engines

1226
01:19:41,257 --> 01:19:43,757
[Russian] How the eff does he
know about the engines?

1227
01:19:44,917 --> 01:19:46,667
Were you aware that he knows?

1228
01:19:46,877 --> 01:19:48,297
How would I know?

1229
01:19:50,667 --> 01:19:54,007
Sir, how do you know
about the KVD-1 engin-

1230
01:19:54,087 --> 01:19:55,587
Hey! Easy

1231
01:20:02,257 --> 01:20:04,707
How do you know about KVD-1 engines?

1232
01:20:04,877 --> 01:20:06,587
Oh! Please don't worry about that

1233
01:20:06,707 --> 01:20:07,837
I also know

1234
01:20:07,917 --> 01:20:09,917
That you have 252 engines

1235
01:20:10,007 --> 01:20:11,207
All I am asking for is

1236
01:20:11,257 --> 01:20:14,007
4 engines and technology transfer

1237
01:20:16,297 --> 01:20:17,547
[Russian] What the hell!

1238
01:20:18,667 --> 01:20:20,047
He knows that too

1239
01:20:20,707 --> 01:20:23,547
He probably knows the color
of our innerwear too!

1240
01:20:24,377 --> 01:20:26,087
Be careful dealing with him

1241
01:20:27,507 --> 01:20:28,547
Nambi

1242
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:30,547
You are a dangerous man!

1243
01:20:31,257 --> 01:20:33,337
This is extremely classified information

1244
01:20:33,337 --> 01:20:35,087
How did you get access to it?

1245
01:20:35,127 --> 01:20:38,087
[Russian] 'If I tell you that,
you will die'

1246
01:20:38,297 --> 01:20:39,507
'And I will die!'

1247
01:20:42,957 --> 01:20:44,957
Listen, don't worry about it

1248
01:20:45,127 --> 01:20:46,797
That's all the Russian I know!

1249
01:20:47,337 --> 01:20:49,627
Okay, let me be honest with you

1250
01:20:49,957 --> 01:20:51,957
Our country is in shambles right now

1251
01:20:52,007 --> 01:20:53,707
Our economy is in danger

1252
01:20:53,757 --> 01:20:56,007
At Glavskosmos
we really need this deal

1253
01:20:56,797 --> 01:20:58,007
So here is what we do

1254
01:20:58,007 --> 01:21:01,167
Do not mention the names in the contract
Just say that you need an engine with-

1255
01:21:01,207 --> 01:21:03,167
With a specific impulse of 461!

1256
01:21:06,837 --> 01:21:08,337
Yeah...that

1257
01:21:10,297 --> 01:21:11,917
And I will do my best

1258
01:21:13,167 --> 01:21:14,297
I'm sure you will

1259
01:21:14,757 --> 01:21:17,047
- Sir, may I come in?
- Yes, Nambi

1260
01:21:18,507 --> 01:21:20,547
Have you started
training your replacements?

1261
01:21:20,587 --> 01:21:22,417
I'll start in a couple of days, sir

1262
01:21:22,417 --> 01:21:24,707
Did you go through
the Russian contract?

1263
01:21:24,837 --> 01:21:26,707
Hmmm, I went through it

1264
01:21:27,047 --> 01:21:28,667
Are we making a mistake again?

1265
01:21:28,707 --> 01:21:31,457
14 years ago we could have
bought this technology from France

1266
01:21:31,457 --> 01:21:32,627
For 10 million

1267
01:21:32,957 --> 01:21:36,007
But then too, in the favor of being
too premature we let the deal go

1268
01:21:36,007 --> 01:21:40,337
And today France is asking us
10 billion for the exact same technology

1269
01:21:40,707 --> 01:21:41,917
I rest my case!

1270
01:21:43,757 --> 01:21:44,797
Okay

1271
01:21:45,877 --> 01:21:49,257
The Russian quotation is exactly
1⁄4th that of the others

1272
01:21:50,547 --> 01:21:51,667
First class technology

1273
01:21:52,087 --> 01:21:53,087
But

1274
01:21:53,627 --> 01:21:57,707
On account of being the cheapest
they will be disqualified

1275
01:21:57,797 --> 01:21:58,917
I know, sir

1276
01:21:59,087 --> 01:22:00,587
But I think I have a solution

1277
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:02,007
Just leave it to me

1278
01:22:26,087 --> 01:22:27,207
Thank you

1279
01:22:41,507 --> 01:22:43,627
[Russian] Why are the Indians
being so generous?

1280
01:22:44,207 --> 01:22:45,667
What do you mean?

1281
01:22:46,757 --> 01:22:50,627
For a meagre extra hardware
they are paying much more than its worth

1282
01:22:50,877 --> 01:22:53,757
- Should we be worried?
- Nothing to worry

1283
01:22:54,837 --> 01:22:57,877
Too desperate to broker this deal
we didn't realize the value of what we had

1284
01:22:58,047 --> 01:22:59,957
But Nambi did and
he's just being fair

1285
01:23:00,707 --> 01:23:02,917
That is why we love the Indians

1286
01:23:20,207 --> 01:23:22,087
There's no balance in this world

1287
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:23,507
Why?

1288
01:23:24,087 --> 01:23:25,417
Don't rub it in

1289
01:23:29,167 --> 01:23:30,337
She's coming

1290
01:23:32,587 --> 01:23:35,007
Be brave and speak
with your mouth open

1291
01:23:35,047 --> 01:23:36,087
Understood?

1292
01:23:48,837 --> 01:23:50,507
- Mr Nambi
- Hi

1293
01:23:51,707 --> 01:23:54,377
So what are you thinking about so deeply?

1294
01:23:54,837 --> 01:23:56,587
I was just thinking how

1295
01:23:57,007 --> 01:24:00,457
...my wife would love a saree
in the color of your dress

1296
01:24:00,587 --> 01:24:02,297
This is her favorite color

1297
01:24:03,627 --> 01:24:05,587
I'm sure she misses you very much

1298
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:07,087
I'm sure she does

1299
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:08,457
Thank you

1300
01:24:09,087 --> 01:24:12,837
Ma'am, I would like you to meet another
brilliant rocket scientist from ISRO

1301
01:24:12,877 --> 01:24:14,007
Mr Param

1302
01:24:14,837 --> 01:24:16,457
Nice to meet you, Mr Param

1303
01:24:16,877 --> 01:24:18,127
[incoherent muttering]

1304
01:24:19,797 --> 01:24:20,837
Goodbye

1305
01:24:20,917 --> 01:24:21,957
Goodnight

1306
01:24:24,707 --> 01:24:28,007
Sir, only you understood
your 'pleased to meet you'

1307
01:24:29,547 --> 01:24:31,337
There's no balance in this world!

1308
01:24:32,047 --> 01:24:35,957
Sir, we should stop sniffing around here
We'll find you a bride closer to home

1309
01:24:36,007 --> 01:24:37,087
Impossible

1310
01:24:37,127 --> 01:24:39,007
Sir, everything is possible

1311
01:24:39,047 --> 01:24:40,337
Impossible!

1312
01:24:40,797 --> 01:24:43,007
How does he land up wherever we are?

1313
01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:44,667
'Mr Barry'

1314
01:24:45,837 --> 01:24:46,917
Gentlemen

1315
01:24:47,047 --> 01:24:48,047
Nambi

1316
01:24:48,507 --> 01:24:49,877
What are you guys doing here?

1317
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:51,257
You know usual Govt work

1318
01:24:51,297 --> 01:24:52,417
But seriously

1319
01:24:52,457 --> 01:24:54,587
Am I following you
or you following me?

1320
01:24:55,587 --> 01:24:58,627
It is definitely me who is trying
to follow you and that's not easy!

1321
01:24:58,667 --> 01:25:01,087
- You are an exceptional man, Nambi
- Thank you

1322
01:25:01,457 --> 01:25:03,167
You know what? I want
to show you something

1323
01:25:03,207 --> 01:25:04,207
Come with me

1324
01:25:08,797 --> 01:25:10,047
I want to ask you something

1325
01:25:11,047 --> 01:25:13,627
You know the work done at NASA
benefits the whole world

1326
01:25:13,667 --> 01:25:15,877
From artificial limbs to heart pumps

1327
01:25:16,007 --> 01:25:17,797
Road safety to improved tyres

1328
01:25:17,877 --> 01:25:21,007
Our contribution really hasn't made
the world a safer place for humans

1329
01:25:21,297 --> 01:25:22,757
But I always wondered

1330
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:25,007
Humanity would have been better served

1331
01:25:26,127 --> 01:25:27,297
If you worked in NASA

1332
01:25:27,917 --> 01:25:29,587
Instead of what you are doing now

1333
01:25:29,837 --> 01:25:31,047
No offense

1334
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:33,257
But could you imagine?

1335
01:25:35,917 --> 01:25:38,757
What all you could've accomplished
with the absolute best resources

1336
01:25:38,797 --> 01:25:40,507
Completely at your disposal

1337
01:25:41,087 --> 01:25:42,207
So I'm curious

1338
01:25:44,587 --> 01:25:46,667
Why did you say 'no'
to NASA's offer, Nambi?

1339
01:25:51,207 --> 01:25:52,207
Yeah

1340
01:25:53,257 --> 01:25:54,547
Yeah, I know

1341
01:25:55,337 --> 01:25:58,047
There should be a photograph
of you in the Oxford dictionary

1342
01:25:58,457 --> 01:26:00,917
Right next to the definition
of the word 'Patriotism'

1343
01:26:06,957 --> 01:26:08,047
So...uh

1344
01:26:08,507 --> 01:26:10,707
- What are you doing here in Moscow?
- Me?

1345
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:11,757
Oh! You know

1346
01:26:12,257 --> 01:26:13,457
Usual Govt work

1347
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:19,707
What happened?

1348
01:26:19,957 --> 01:26:21,507
What is the emergency?

1349
01:26:21,507 --> 01:26:23,457
I don't know if you are aware, but-

1350
01:26:23,587 --> 01:26:27,257
USSR as a nation
will cease to exist tomorrow

1351
01:26:28,667 --> 01:26:31,587
The Americans, who are as it is, pissed off

1352
01:26:31,587 --> 01:26:34,547
That you haven't awarded
the contract to them

1353
01:26:34,587 --> 01:26:36,667
But given it to us instead

1354
01:26:36,957 --> 01:26:40,257
...are taking advantage
of the prevailing situation

1355
01:26:40,297 --> 01:26:45,047
And claiming that Russia is
in violation with MTCR

1356
01:26:45,377 --> 01:26:48,127
By selling the cryogenic engines to India

1357
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:51,757
When did a cryogenic engine become
a weapon of mass destruction?

1358
01:26:51,797 --> 01:26:53,457
And that too with a 500 kg payload?

1359
01:26:53,457 --> 01:26:55,797
When have Americans ever played fair?

1360
01:26:56,877 --> 01:27:00,917
I suspect they have an eye
on all 252 of them

1361
01:27:01,837 --> 01:27:07,167
And they are claiming that India
is using the KVD-1s to develop the ICBM

1362
01:27:08,257 --> 01:27:10,047
And if we go ahead
with this contract

1363
01:27:10,087 --> 01:27:12,797
They will impose heavy
punitive sanctions on us

1364
01:27:13,297 --> 01:27:14,797
We are sorry, Nambi

1365
01:27:16,507 --> 01:27:19,757
This will stop us from competing
in the satellite launch markets

1366
01:27:20,707 --> 01:27:22,417
And push us back by decades!

1367
01:27:24,007 --> 01:27:25,377
We are so close

1368
01:27:27,707 --> 01:27:29,457
[Russian] I just got a call from Kremlin

1369
01:27:31,337 --> 01:27:32,877
We have to make this happen

1370
01:27:33,297 --> 01:27:35,047
We have to help the Indians

1371
01:27:36,957 --> 01:27:38,417
What do you mean?

1372
01:27:43,707 --> 01:27:46,627
The Indians have always been good to us

1373
01:27:47,797 --> 01:27:50,377
And this man Nambi
has been very kind and fair

1374
01:27:52,257 --> 01:27:53,917
We can't let him down

1375
01:27:55,127 --> 01:28:00,457
The Kremlin has ordered me
to see if we can help him out

1376
01:28:02,667 --> 01:28:04,587
What do you suggest we do?

1377
01:28:07,917 --> 01:28:10,757
Nambi, do you have an idea
how we can work it out?

1378
01:28:12,547 --> 01:28:13,547
Yes

1379
01:28:13,917 --> 01:28:15,047
We actually do

1380
01:28:17,047 --> 01:28:20,047
Technically, all 4 engines
are ready for delivery

1381
01:28:20,877 --> 01:28:23,337
The deferred payments
were for India's convenience

1382
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:26,297
What if we expedite the payments?

1383
01:28:27,957 --> 01:28:30,457
Will you be able to handle
all 4 engines in one go?

1384
01:28:35,127 --> 01:28:36,957
That's great idea, Nambi

1385
01:28:39,127 --> 01:28:41,837
I can get the team here to comply

1386
01:28:43,297 --> 01:28:44,587
This will be a win-win

1387
01:28:47,337 --> 01:28:48,507
You guys win

1388
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:51,007
I get screwed

1389
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:55,337
Do you really think I am that stupid?

1390
01:28:58,377 --> 01:28:59,507
Okay, look

1391
01:29:00,127 --> 01:29:03,127
I can pick up the engines
wherever in Russia

1392
01:29:03,207 --> 01:29:05,707
And deliver them anywhere in Russia

1393
01:29:07,377 --> 01:29:09,587
But I can't take them out of the country

1394
01:29:13,917 --> 01:29:16,087
What do you say, Mr Nambi?

1395
01:29:18,547 --> 01:29:20,087
Can you handle shipping?

1396
01:29:22,047 --> 01:29:26,167
Professor Rao, there's no way Ural airlines
will do it for less than 90 lakh rupees

1397
01:29:26,257 --> 01:29:28,797
Nambi, is there no limit
to your demands?

1398
01:29:29,007 --> 01:29:31,757
I just got the payment
for the engines released in full

1399
01:29:31,797 --> 01:29:35,047
Now you want another
90 lakhs for Ural airlines?

1400
01:29:35,127 --> 01:29:36,707
Where will I go for the money?

1401
01:29:36,757 --> 01:29:38,667
How many times do you
want me to go to the PMO?

1402
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:41,007
'Sir, I'm not asking 90 lakhs for myself'

1403
01:29:41,047 --> 01:29:42,837
Ask our Grand National airlines

1404
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:44,587
Why didn't they live up
to their promise?

1405
01:29:44,627 --> 01:29:46,377
We wouldn't be
in this dilemma now, right?

1406
01:29:46,667 --> 01:29:49,297
'Now we have no choice
but to go with Ural airlines'

1407
01:29:49,337 --> 01:29:52,957
Sir, at this moment,
our need is more than theirs

1408
01:29:53,167 --> 01:29:56,457
Because if the Russians
don't give us the cryogenic engines

1409
01:29:56,837 --> 01:29:58,757
The Americans certainly won't oblige

1410
01:29:58,797 --> 01:30:00,667
'The French will take
advantage of our plight'

1411
01:30:00,707 --> 01:30:02,587
'And sell it to us at 5 times the cost'

1412
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:05,627
That will be the end of
India's cryogenic dreams forever

1413
01:30:06,587 --> 01:30:08,627
Okay, give me some time, sir

1414
01:30:08,667 --> 01:30:11,417
- Phone from PM's office
- 'Americans are not making our lives easy'

1415
01:30:11,457 --> 01:30:12,457
Nambi, 1 minute

1416
01:30:13,377 --> 01:30:14,377
Yes, sir

1417
01:30:14,417 --> 01:30:16,587
'The fund has been sanctioned'

1418
01:30:16,667 --> 01:30:17,667
Okay, sir

1419
01:30:17,707 --> 01:30:20,377
'Congratulations, Nambi
Your fund has been approved'

1420
01:30:20,377 --> 01:30:22,087
'Now go, get us those bloody engines'

1421
01:30:22,127 --> 01:30:23,627
Thank you so very much, sir

1422
01:30:23,837 --> 01:30:24,837
I'll definitely bring

1423
01:30:24,877 --> 01:30:25,877
Thanks, Kalam

1424
01:30:25,917 --> 01:30:28,047
- 'May I speak to Nambi?'
- I'll patch you on to Nambi

1425
01:30:28,087 --> 01:30:29,297
'Sir, patching your call'

1426
01:30:29,547 --> 01:30:30,917
- 'Kalam'
- Nambi?

1427
01:30:33,337 --> 01:30:35,507
As far as solid fuels
are concerned, my work is over

1428
01:30:36,127 --> 01:30:38,047
Now it is time for you
to take us to the stars

1429
01:30:38,587 --> 01:30:39,667
Kalam

1430
01:30:40,007 --> 01:30:42,007
I don't believe doing
anything in small measures

1431
01:30:44,417 --> 01:30:45,797
How are things at the DRDO?

1432
01:30:45,837 --> 01:30:47,297
Going smooth, all well

1433
01:30:49,457 --> 01:30:52,207
But I miss the fun
we had working together

1434
01:30:53,877 --> 01:30:55,507
Anyway all the best

1435
01:30:55,507 --> 01:30:56,547
Bye, Kalam

1436
01:31:01,917 --> 01:31:03,587
Thank God! That's all taken care of

1437
01:31:06,417 --> 01:31:07,667
So we are all set

1438
01:31:08,087 --> 01:31:10,457
Can you promise the engines
will be delivered on time?

1439
01:31:11,547 --> 01:31:15,087
I cannot promise that we will
even be alive 2 hours later!

1440
01:31:16,087 --> 01:31:18,087
That's the state our country is in

1441
01:31:18,257 --> 01:31:21,167
The only thing I can promise
is that I'll try my best

1442
01:31:22,207 --> 01:31:25,957
Since I'm the one flying you out
you can pay me once the job is done

1443
01:31:26,127 --> 01:31:30,297
We will fly from Krasnoyarsk
to avoid attracting any attention

1444
01:31:30,667 --> 01:31:33,507
Americans are definitely
going to keep an eye out for us

1445
01:31:35,007 --> 01:31:38,377
The Americans will be looking out
for flights leaving for India

1446
01:31:38,877 --> 01:31:40,707
What are your suggestions?

1447
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:45,917
I think we should fly to Karachi

1448
01:31:46,877 --> 01:31:48,797
Re-fuel and then fly to Trivandrum

1449
01:31:48,877 --> 01:31:49,877
Karachi?

1450
01:31:50,377 --> 01:31:51,707
The Americans would
never imagine

1451
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:55,207
...we would take rocket parts
to our hostile enemy nation

1452
01:31:55,547 --> 01:31:57,797
And the Pakistanis would
never search a Russian aircraft

1453
01:31:57,877 --> 01:31:59,127
Brilliant strategy!

1454
01:32:00,457 --> 01:32:01,757
That's a great idea

1455
01:32:02,457 --> 01:32:05,507
While we are at it
let's get the engines drunk

1456
01:32:06,507 --> 01:32:08,087
Drunk?
What do you mean?

1457
01:32:08,457 --> 01:32:09,547
Dismantle them

1458
01:32:09,757 --> 01:32:11,377
Hide them in the vodka crates

1459
01:32:13,047 --> 01:32:14,457
Another good idea!

1460
01:32:38,087 --> 01:32:39,587
The Americans know

1461
01:32:39,757 --> 01:32:41,167
They are on their way here

1462
01:32:41,207 --> 01:32:42,297
We have to leave

1463
01:32:42,297 --> 01:32:45,127
What do you mean 'leave'?
2nd consignment is just taking off

1464
01:32:45,127 --> 01:32:47,507
I need the nozzle assembly kit
of all the four engines

1465
01:32:47,547 --> 01:32:50,417
As well as some parts of the 4th engine
I'm not leaving without that

1466
01:32:50,547 --> 01:32:52,087
[Russian] Give me the damn radio!

1467
01:32:52,877 --> 01:32:54,957
Nambi, you and your colleagues
have to leave now

1468
01:32:54,957 --> 01:32:56,757
Or your lives will be in danger

1469
01:32:58,047 --> 01:33:00,127
Official orders from your chairman ISRO

1470
01:33:01,957 --> 01:33:03,667
[Russian] Sven, hold the take off

1471
01:33:06,877 --> 01:33:08,457
What about the rest of my parts?

1472
01:33:08,547 --> 01:33:10,167
Rest of the 3rd consignment?

1473
01:33:10,207 --> 01:33:11,667
There's no TIME!

1474
01:33:14,127 --> 01:33:15,877
Think about your families

1475
01:35:02,917 --> 01:35:03,957
Wow, sir!

1476
01:35:05,207 --> 01:35:07,837
Only in cinemas we are heroes, sir

1477
01:35:08,457 --> 01:35:09,837
What an inspiring life!

1478
01:35:11,757 --> 01:35:14,297
Holding the engine in one hand
and your life in the other

1479
01:35:14,547 --> 01:35:16,207
You've made the impossible possible

1480
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:17,627
What an adventure!

1481
01:35:17,667 --> 01:35:20,377
This sounds...James Bond
like a spy thriller to me

1482
01:35:22,257 --> 01:35:24,337
- Thank you
- The next 3 years

1483
01:35:25,587 --> 01:35:28,957
Even after the retirement of
U R Rao who supported you

1484
01:35:29,457 --> 01:35:31,707
You did not stop with
your efforts to reach your goal

1485
01:35:31,797 --> 01:35:34,457
With no manuals or guidance

1486
01:35:35,167 --> 01:35:37,207
You were assembling
the cryogenic engines

1487
01:35:38,127 --> 01:35:40,257
But before your cryogenics dream
could come true

1488
01:35:41,087 --> 01:35:43,757
Your dream turned into a curse

1489
01:35:44,877 --> 01:35:46,007
'Am I right?'

1490
01:36:11,207 --> 01:36:14,087
'There is free-for-all chaos
that has started in Kerala'

1491
01:36:14,127 --> 01:36:15,757
'The case has been
handed over to us'

1492
01:36:15,797 --> 01:36:17,127
'Look into the preliminaries'

1493
01:36:17,167 --> 01:36:18,257
Right away, sir

1494
01:36:24,207 --> 01:36:26,457
'Give me one more day
I'll make him cough up everything'

1495
01:36:26,507 --> 01:36:27,957
'Are you out of your mind?'

1496
01:36:27,957 --> 01:36:30,627
'Entire media is in front of
the police station from this morning'

1497
01:36:30,667 --> 01:36:33,257
Shift him to Latex guest house immediately

1498
01:36:33,297 --> 01:36:34,297
Okay, sir

1499
01:36:36,667 --> 01:36:37,917
Move aside

1500
01:36:40,377 --> 01:36:41,757
'Sir...sir'

1501
01:36:45,917 --> 01:36:48,127
Move...make way

1502
01:36:58,337 --> 01:36:59,377
Hello, sir

1503
01:36:59,797 --> 01:37:00,957
How are you?

1504
01:37:01,917 --> 01:37:03,507
I'm fine, who are you?

1505
01:37:05,547 --> 01:37:07,587
Why have you arrested me?
Which department are you?

1506
01:37:07,627 --> 01:37:08,707
We'll tell you, sir

1507
01:37:09,457 --> 01:37:11,007
Hey! Get a cup of tea for sir

1508
01:37:12,337 --> 01:37:15,457
How did a man of your stature
stoop to this level, sir?

1509
01:37:16,337 --> 01:37:17,957
This case is absolute nonsense

1510
01:37:18,337 --> 01:37:20,127
I have been ordered
to interrogate you

1511
01:37:20,507 --> 01:37:23,417
But just as a formality
we have a few questions to ask

1512
01:37:23,457 --> 01:37:24,627
All that's fine, sir

1513
01:37:24,707 --> 01:37:27,377
But why did they arrest me
like a common criminal, sir?

1514
01:37:27,837 --> 01:37:29,087
That too outside a temple?

1515
01:37:29,127 --> 01:37:31,707
Somebody pushed me
Pinned my neck down with his knee

1516
01:37:31,707 --> 01:37:33,547
This is not the way, sir
I'm an ISRO scientist

1517
01:37:33,587 --> 01:37:35,007
- Sorry, sir
- This is not acceptable

1518
01:37:35,047 --> 01:37:36,627
I apologize on their behalf, sir

1519
01:37:37,667 --> 01:37:41,917
It's just that, some of these officers
just don't know how to behave

1520
01:37:42,917 --> 01:37:44,257
You aren't hurt, right?

1521
01:37:45,377 --> 01:37:46,507
No

1522
01:37:46,757 --> 01:37:49,337
Please ask me whatever question you want

1523
01:37:49,337 --> 01:37:51,457
I have to go back home
My family is waiting for me

1524
01:37:51,877 --> 01:37:52,917
Thank you

1525
01:37:52,957 --> 01:37:55,087
Sir, who is this Mariam Rasheeda?

1526
01:37:55,797 --> 01:37:57,507
- Mariam, who?
- Rasheeda

1527
01:37:58,547 --> 01:37:59,957
Mariam Rasheeda?

1528
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:03,207
I don't know
Was she working in ISRO?

1529
01:38:28,087 --> 01:38:29,257
Let him go

1530
01:38:30,007 --> 01:38:31,457
What do you think
you are doing, man?

1531
01:38:31,457 --> 01:38:33,837
Brainless or what? Is this how
you behave with a scientist?

1532
01:38:34,297 --> 01:38:35,627
CONTROL YOURSELF!

1533
01:38:39,757 --> 01:38:40,877
I'm sorry, sir

1534
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:45,007
Are you okay?

1535
01:38:46,047 --> 01:38:48,167
Sir, I wish to apologize on his behalf

1536
01:38:48,207 --> 01:38:49,627
He's always like this

1537
01:38:51,457 --> 01:38:55,877
Sir, the thing is, we need
information about this woman Mariam

1538
01:38:56,337 --> 01:38:59,207
And why you sold
rocket technology to Pakistan?

1539
01:38:59,257 --> 01:39:00,877
- This is all we want
- Sir, I don't know

1540
01:39:00,877 --> 01:39:03,007
And if we don't get this information-

1541
01:39:06,257 --> 01:39:08,337
We'll bury you alive in this guest house

1542
01:39:10,207 --> 01:39:14,087
We are shedding our blood
and sweat to protect our nation

1543
01:39:14,257 --> 01:39:17,627
'And you think you can sell
our nation for a few quick bucks?

1544
01:39:17,667 --> 01:39:18,917
Bloody traitor!

1545
01:39:35,457 --> 01:39:36,797
Now that you've had a good bath

1546
01:39:36,797 --> 01:39:38,457
- Let's start our prayers
- Wait

1547
01:39:42,207 --> 01:39:43,207
Look here

1548
01:39:43,507 --> 01:39:45,007
Let's not waste each other's time

1549
01:39:45,337 --> 01:39:46,667
Come to the point

1550
01:39:47,587 --> 01:39:50,917
You met that Maldivian woman
and you slept with her

1551
01:39:51,127 --> 01:39:52,917
You got caught in a honey trap

1552
01:39:53,337 --> 01:39:55,837
And to get out of it
you sold our country's secrets

1553
01:39:56,957 --> 01:39:58,587
This is the sequence of events

1554
01:39:58,627 --> 01:40:00,877
You had better confess
and we'll go easy on you

1555
01:40:04,127 --> 01:40:07,377
So while you are at it, why don't you
make me to confess about the Bofors case?

1556
01:40:07,417 --> 01:40:10,457
And the share market scandal also?

1557
01:40:14,587 --> 01:40:16,507
He's funny, eh?
Good sense of humor

1558
01:40:16,547 --> 01:40:19,337
I think we should show him
our sense of humor

1559
01:40:21,757 --> 01:40:23,047
O' Mother Goddess!

1560
01:40:34,627 --> 01:40:36,377
[Malayalam] 'This case'
is getting serious'

1561
01:40:36,377 --> 01:40:38,047
'Big heads will roll
We should be careful'

1562
01:40:49,457 --> 01:40:50,917
Traitors don't deserve to sit!

1563
01:40:58,337 --> 01:40:59,377
Fine

1564
01:40:59,917 --> 01:41:01,007
I won't sit

1565
01:41:02,667 --> 01:41:04,417
But you are wrong

1566
01:41:05,257 --> 01:41:08,087
Because I was never in Madras
on the 24th of January

1567
01:41:09,087 --> 01:41:10,417
WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU?!

1568
01:41:12,417 --> 01:41:14,207
That is none of your business!

1569
01:41:15,507 --> 01:41:17,587
Who do you think I am, huh?

1570
01:41:19,917 --> 01:41:22,917
You think I don't know
this telephone is a recorder?

1571
01:41:24,007 --> 01:41:26,007
You assumed I would repeat
everything you say

1572
01:41:26,047 --> 01:41:28,757
And you would record it
and use it as my confession?

1573
01:41:29,507 --> 01:41:31,257
What do you take me for...a fool?

1574
01:41:34,257 --> 01:41:36,547
I am a Rocket Scientist!

1575
01:41:37,457 --> 01:41:38,667
Scientist?

1576
01:41:39,007 --> 01:41:42,667
You will know as time goes by
what you should and shouldn't say

1577
01:41:46,297 --> 01:41:47,877
We are just getting started

1578
01:41:50,337 --> 01:41:52,837
Where were you on the 24th of January?

1579
01:41:59,507 --> 01:42:01,587
'I met N...Nrambi Narayan'

1580
01:42:01,627 --> 01:42:03,377
'In a hotel room'

1581
01:42:07,377 --> 01:42:08,917
'Forget about a confession'

1582
01:42:09,587 --> 01:42:12,257
'This man won't be alive until tomorrow
at the rate you are going!'

1583
01:42:13,047 --> 01:42:14,337
BP is low

1584
01:42:14,547 --> 01:42:15,837
Heart rate is off the chart

1585
01:42:16,377 --> 01:42:18,257
'We have to revive him immediately'

1586
01:42:38,957 --> 01:42:39,957
Get up

1587
01:42:49,127 --> 01:42:52,047
Sir, this is Nambi Narayanan
I came to hand over this case to you

1588
01:42:53,707 --> 01:42:55,007
Hello, Mr Narayanan

1589
01:42:55,047 --> 01:42:56,837
I am P M Nair from the CBI

1590
01:42:57,957 --> 01:43:00,167
Thank you for telling me
your name and department

1591
01:43:01,127 --> 01:43:03,337
The three others before you
didn't tell me anything

1592
01:43:05,127 --> 01:43:06,297
Like some tea?

1593
01:43:07,167 --> 01:43:08,257
'Please sit down'

1594
01:43:09,797 --> 01:43:11,337
Gopal, sit down
Drink tea before you go

1595
01:43:11,377 --> 01:43:12,917
- No, it's okay
- Please sit down

1596
01:43:12,957 --> 01:43:14,417
Have a cup of tea with us

1597
01:43:19,957 --> 01:43:21,167
How are you doing?

1598
01:43:25,167 --> 01:43:26,377
- Sir-
- Yeah, please come

1599
01:43:26,377 --> 01:43:27,547
Sit...sit here

1600
01:43:28,207 --> 01:43:29,587
Rajashekar, please sit here

1601
01:43:30,507 --> 01:43:31,507
Fauziya, please sit

1602
01:43:32,417 --> 01:43:33,417
Mariam

1603
01:43:43,917 --> 01:43:46,877
Sir, I just came to hand over
the case, I am leaving

1604
01:43:46,877 --> 01:43:48,707
- Sit down, Gopal, please
- No, it's okay, sir

1605
01:43:48,757 --> 01:43:49,877
Gopal, sit down

1606
01:43:55,707 --> 01:43:56,797
Mariam

1607
01:43:59,167 --> 01:44:00,547
Do you recognize

1608
01:44:02,337 --> 01:44:03,337
...this man?

1609
01:44:14,127 --> 01:44:15,207
Yes, sir

1610
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:18,757
He's the bastard

1611
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:22,007
...who threatened to put ice
on my private parts, sir

1612
01:44:22,547 --> 01:44:23,627
Sir, she's lying

1613
01:44:23,667 --> 01:44:26,507
- Damn you! I'll break your bones
- Quiet...quiet!

1614
01:44:26,547 --> 01:44:30,007
Will you stop talking to her in Malayalam?
She only understands English

1615
01:44:30,007 --> 01:44:32,047
Are you saying you do NOT recognize her?

1616
01:44:32,087 --> 01:44:34,337
'No, sir, somebody else
put her in this situation'

1617
01:44:34,457 --> 01:44:36,627
Sir, he said he would rape me
in front of my daughter

1618
01:44:36,627 --> 01:44:38,087
'If I don't do as he said'

1619
01:44:38,127 --> 01:44:39,337
- How dare you!
- Quiet, Gopal

1620
01:44:39,337 --> 01:44:42,127
- You know whom you're talking to?
- Gopal, sit down

1621
01:44:42,167 --> 01:44:43,957
QUIET, GOPAL!
Sit down

1622
01:44:52,337 --> 01:44:53,337
Mariam?

1623
01:44:55,257 --> 01:44:56,377
You know him?

1624
01:45:02,837 --> 01:45:03,917
Yes

1625
01:45:06,207 --> 01:45:07,507
'Where have you met him?'

1626
01:45:08,757 --> 01:45:10,457
Actually I have never met him, sir

1627
01:45:13,757 --> 01:45:15,547
I just heard his name once

1628
01:45:15,587 --> 01:45:18,707
My arrest was done and the inspector
showed his pictures to us

1629
01:45:18,757 --> 01:45:21,707
And we were...trained to say his name

1630
01:45:21,757 --> 01:45:24,917
Nam...Nambi...Nambi Nara-

1631
01:45:25,417 --> 01:45:26,797
Is that what you were doing?

1632
01:45:26,837 --> 01:45:28,917
Reading off a board
during the confession?

1633
01:45:28,957 --> 01:45:31,337
Yes, they were holding it for us to read

1634
01:45:31,377 --> 01:45:32,837
I'm sorry, sir
I have to go

1635
01:45:32,877 --> 01:45:33,917
GOPAL!

1636
01:45:40,797 --> 01:45:42,957
I need to speak to Mr Narayanan alone

1637
01:45:52,587 --> 01:45:56,047
We were beaten and tortured
to say your name in this case

1638
01:45:58,087 --> 01:45:59,507
We had no option

1639
01:45:59,877 --> 01:46:01,007
We are very sorry

1640
01:46:08,127 --> 01:46:09,167
Sorry

1641
01:46:16,837 --> 01:46:18,297
Have some tea please

1642
01:46:20,757 --> 01:46:21,837
Not to worry

1643
01:46:22,007 --> 01:46:23,587
Relax, drink your tea

1644
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:29,207
[saucer clattering]

1645
01:46:33,127 --> 01:46:34,257
3rd degree?

1646
01:46:36,707 --> 01:46:37,957
What do you think?

1647
01:46:39,757 --> 01:46:42,837
If they hadn't called a doctor
in the middle of the night to revive me

1648
01:46:43,167 --> 01:46:45,377
I wouldn't be sitting here in front of you

1649
01:46:46,007 --> 01:46:47,837
CBI is already on to the case

1650
01:46:48,377 --> 01:46:50,797
They had no business questioning you

1651
01:46:51,707 --> 01:46:53,007
Questioning me?

1652
01:46:54,007 --> 01:46:55,797
They weren't here to question me

1653
01:46:56,757 --> 01:47:00,547
They wanted to beat a confession
out of me for a crime I didn't commit

1654
01:47:00,627 --> 01:47:01,877
What confession?

1655
01:47:02,337 --> 01:47:05,127
That I sold rocketry secrets
to Pakistan for 9-

1656
01:47:13,417 --> 01:47:14,837
I'm not recording you

1657
01:47:14,877 --> 01:47:16,707
If I need to record you
I'll let you know

1658
01:47:18,047 --> 01:47:20,587
That in return for sleeping
with one of these women

1659
01:47:21,377 --> 01:47:24,127
I sold my nation's rocketry secrets
to Pakistan it seems

1660
01:47:25,457 --> 01:47:28,377
And they paid me $9 lakhs for it

1661
01:47:29,007 --> 01:47:31,627
And this deal happened in
Hotel International in Chennai

1662
01:47:31,667 --> 01:47:33,547
On the 24th of January it seems

1663
01:47:34,417 --> 01:47:35,457
And...?

1664
01:47:38,377 --> 01:47:40,087
And all of this is a lie

1665
01:47:41,757 --> 01:47:45,547
How can I sell technology to Pakistan
that our country does not possess?

1666
01:47:47,167 --> 01:47:49,757
And the designs I allegedly
sold to Pakistan are available

1667
01:47:49,757 --> 01:47:53,207
In any book store anywhere in the world
for a mere sum of Rs 200

1668
01:47:54,257 --> 01:47:56,757
You can't build a rocket engine
with all those so called facts

1669
01:47:58,667 --> 01:48:01,627
Sir, this is Rocket Science

1670
01:48:02,507 --> 01:48:06,627
52 scientists worked in close collaboration
with French scientists for 3 years

1671
01:48:06,837 --> 01:48:10,877
And it still took us 16 years
to build our own rocket engines

1672
01:48:12,007 --> 01:48:13,047
And

1673
01:48:14,087 --> 01:48:16,417
Today is the first time
I have met these 2 ladies

1674
01:48:17,007 --> 01:48:18,007
And

1675
01:48:19,207 --> 01:48:21,377
They have their facts completely wrong

1676
01:48:22,337 --> 01:48:26,877
On the 23rd of January
I was attending my friend's funeral

1677
01:48:27,797 --> 01:48:30,797
And on January 25th, it was
my granddaughter's first birthday

1678
01:48:31,757 --> 01:48:34,167
On 24th, the day in question

1679
01:48:34,337 --> 01:48:35,917
I was not in Madras

1680
01:48:36,547 --> 01:48:38,507
I was in Trivandrum in ISRO

1681
01:48:39,837 --> 01:48:42,257
If you want, you can check
the vehicle log books

1682
01:48:46,917 --> 01:48:49,257
I'll try and get to the bottom
of this as soon as possible

1683
01:48:49,837 --> 01:48:53,337
Meanwhile for your safety
I need to move you to judicial custody

1684
01:48:55,417 --> 01:48:56,957
I just have one last question

1685
01:48:57,707 --> 01:49:00,417
As innocent as you say you are

1686
01:49:01,257 --> 01:49:03,547
Why has no one from ISRO
come to your aid?

1687
01:49:04,087 --> 01:49:06,457
Nobody has even come
and seen you so far in jail

1688
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:08,257
Why?

1689
01:49:10,837 --> 01:49:12,337
I don't know, sir

1690
01:49:17,957 --> 01:49:20,257
Maybe scientists are strange people!

1691
01:49:24,547 --> 01:49:26,757
They know exactly how to
react when a rocket fails

1692
01:49:26,797 --> 01:49:29,547
Maybe they don't know
how to react when a man collapses!

1693
01:49:45,297 --> 01:49:47,167
Hey! A visitor is here to see you

1694
01:49:58,257 --> 01:49:59,257
Wow!

1695
01:50:00,297 --> 01:50:01,707
What timing!

1696
01:50:03,457 --> 01:50:06,667
If someone had asked me who would
have been my 1st visitor in jail

1697
01:50:07,917 --> 01:50:10,957
I would have never guessed
it would've been you in a 1000 years

1698
01:50:13,547 --> 01:50:15,207
How are you doing, Mr Unni?

1699
01:50:22,007 --> 01:50:23,417
Congratulations, Mr Unni

1700
01:50:25,627 --> 01:50:27,757
The state you were yearning to see me in

1701
01:50:28,627 --> 01:50:30,957
I am standing right in front of you
fulfilling your wish!

1702
01:50:32,587 --> 01:50:34,207
Beaten, disheveled
and in soiled clothes

1703
01:50:34,457 --> 01:50:35,757
Broken spirit

1704
01:50:36,167 --> 01:50:37,507
Family humiliated

1705
01:50:39,337 --> 01:50:40,507
Career in shambles

1706
01:50:40,547 --> 01:50:41,757
Look, I've peed in my pant

1707
01:50:42,207 --> 01:50:43,457
No bladder control

1708
01:50:45,797 --> 01:50:47,297
And on top of it all

1709
01:50:48,167 --> 01:50:49,837
Branded as a traitor

1710
01:50:54,667 --> 01:50:55,757
But you know what?

1711
01:50:57,007 --> 01:50:58,667
What you went through
because of me

1712
01:50:59,207 --> 01:51:01,547
You are justified in seeing me
in this state, rightfully so

1713
01:51:04,337 --> 01:51:05,667
And for Mr Unni

1714
01:51:06,547 --> 01:51:08,547
I am willing to stand here
for as long as you want

1715
01:51:09,047 --> 01:51:10,377
Feast your eyes

1716
01:51:23,547 --> 01:51:26,457
How I would extract revenge
for what you did to me

1717
01:51:26,457 --> 01:51:28,957
...is something I have thought of
every single day in my life

1718
01:51:30,457 --> 01:51:33,377
Because you lack
basic human kindness

1719
01:51:33,377 --> 01:51:34,757
Temerity from head to toe

1720
01:51:34,877 --> 01:51:38,797
A mean, law unto yourself,
selfish son of a bitch

1721
01:51:39,707 --> 01:51:40,797
'Monster even'

1722
01:51:42,337 --> 01:51:44,877
But even then, in my worst dreams

1723
01:51:44,877 --> 01:51:47,297
I couldn't have imagined
seeing you like this

1724
01:51:54,007 --> 01:51:56,707
But whatever you are,
Mr Nambi Narayanan

1725
01:51:59,457 --> 01:52:03,297
From my unfortunate personal experience

1726
01:52:04,297 --> 01:52:05,457
I know

1727
01:52:07,167 --> 01:52:10,297
You just cannot betray our nation

1728
01:52:15,047 --> 01:52:18,667
It is a shame beyond words
no one visited you in jail so far

1729
01:52:20,627 --> 01:52:22,127
Now that I am here

1730
01:52:24,337 --> 01:52:27,257
Tell me what needs to be done
to get you out of here

1731
01:52:30,297 --> 01:52:31,587
Because in this room

1732
01:52:32,337 --> 01:52:36,087
If you think you are
the only patriot here

1733
01:52:37,957 --> 01:52:40,007
You are making a mistake once more

1734
01:53:16,207 --> 01:53:17,457
'Sir, please do something'

1735
01:53:17,507 --> 01:53:20,377
They are beating appa in jail and
asking him unrelated questions

1736
01:53:20,457 --> 01:53:21,457
Sir, why-

1737
01:53:22,757 --> 01:53:25,507
Sir, they are trying to coerce
sensitive information from him

1738
01:53:25,877 --> 01:53:27,957
'Who is head of cryogenics research?'

1739
01:53:28,007 --> 01:53:29,757
'Who sanctions TOT deals?'

1740
01:53:30,047 --> 01:53:31,957
I don't know why
they need to know all this

1741
01:53:32,507 --> 01:53:34,757
I don't know how much more
Nambi sir can take, sir

1742
01:53:34,797 --> 01:53:37,087
Does anybody in ISRO know what to do?

1743
01:53:37,167 --> 01:53:39,587
- When can we meet appa?
- Sir, please do something

1744
01:53:40,127 --> 01:53:41,837
When can we go and meet appa?

1745
01:53:42,377 --> 01:53:43,667
We can go anytime

1746
01:53:43,707 --> 01:53:46,337
Take a few clothes and some
home cooked food, okay?

1747
01:53:46,877 --> 01:53:48,457
I've packed food for him

1748
01:53:48,507 --> 01:53:49,507
I'll just get his clothes

1749
01:53:49,547 --> 01:53:51,627
Sister, can you make
a cup of tea for me?

1750
01:53:55,127 --> 01:53:57,757
Whatever happens
we cannot take her to jail

1751
01:53:57,917 --> 01:53:59,417
[door bell rings]

1752
01:54:01,047 --> 01:54:03,047
'I seriously don't know
where to begin, sir'

1753
01:54:03,757 --> 01:54:07,337
The sheer audacity and the absurdity
of filing such a case on him shocks me

1754
01:54:07,377 --> 01:54:08,707
It's mind boggling, sir

1755
01:54:10,007 --> 01:54:11,087
I'll show you

1756
01:54:11,207 --> 01:54:14,377
Apart from Nambi Narayanan
there are 5 others in this case, sir

1757
01:54:16,957 --> 01:54:19,797
'Rajashekaran, a Glavskosmos agent'

1758
01:54:19,837 --> 01:54:21,757
'He was working with the Russians'

1759
01:54:21,797 --> 01:54:22,837
Surendran

1760
01:54:22,957 --> 01:54:26,047
'Expert metallurgist with
Cryogenics department at ISRO'

1761
01:54:26,797 --> 01:54:29,007
Fauzya Hassan
Maldivian citizen

1762
01:54:29,667 --> 01:54:31,707
'She came to India to admit
her daughter in school'

1763
01:54:31,707 --> 01:54:33,507
'Along with her friend Mariam Rasheeda'

1764
01:54:36,047 --> 01:54:37,167
Mariam Rasheeda

1765
01:54:37,167 --> 01:54:39,087
'35 year old Maldivian citizen'

1766
01:54:39,127 --> 01:54:41,127
'She sparked the entire chaos'

1767
01:54:41,547 --> 01:54:45,127
'And the common link between
Surendran, Rajashekaran and L D Gopal'

1768
01:54:45,957 --> 01:54:47,547
'And finally L D Gopal'

1769
01:54:47,627 --> 01:54:48,837
'Kerala police'

1770
01:54:48,877 --> 01:54:51,047
'Responsible for the initial arrests'

1771
01:54:51,127 --> 01:54:54,797
'Likely due to a personal grudge
against these women'

1772
01:54:55,535 --> 01:54:59,615
'It is true these women met
L D Gopal, Surendran and Rajashekaran'

1773
01:55:00,825 --> 01:55:02,455
'Some favors were offered'

1774
01:55:02,495 --> 01:55:03,825
'Some taken'

1775
01:55:04,455 --> 01:55:05,705
'Some denied'

1776
01:55:06,535 --> 01:55:09,455
A small regional newspaper published
one of these indiscretions

1777
01:55:09,495 --> 01:55:11,955
Media blew it up into a circus
and the frenzies followed

1778
01:55:12,035 --> 01:55:14,865
'Kerala Police is setting right
the authority within their department'

1779
01:55:14,915 --> 01:55:17,035
'Using this case to their advantage'

1780
01:55:17,665 --> 01:55:19,495
Like bursting crackers
on a non-Deepavali day

1781
01:55:19,495 --> 01:55:22,245
Intelligence Bureau Department
totally unconnected poked its nose too

1782
01:55:22,495 --> 01:55:24,075
Their agenda seems dubious

1783
01:55:24,785 --> 01:55:27,165
'And finally Kerala political parties'

1784
01:55:27,245 --> 01:55:30,615
Jumped into the arena to settle
their long standing feud

1785
01:55:30,865 --> 01:55:32,035
End result is

1786
01:55:32,075 --> 01:55:37,115
'In effect, a hastily concocted
despicable case with inexplicable motives'

1787
01:55:37,455 --> 01:55:40,165
And what is more baffling
is as far as espionage, spying

1788
01:55:40,205 --> 01:55:44,705
And transfer of rocket technology
to Pakistan is concerned

1789
01:55:44,785 --> 01:55:46,035
Forget Nambi, sir

1790
01:55:46,035 --> 01:55:49,325
There is not even an iota of proof to
implicate any of the others in this case

1791
01:55:50,495 --> 01:55:53,165
'These are the facts I have
established in my investigation'

1792
01:55:53,705 --> 01:55:55,825
'Mariam Rasheeda had never
met Nambi Narayanan before'

1793
01:55:56,535 --> 01:55:58,865
They met for the first time
in my presence in custody

1794
01:55:58,915 --> 01:56:02,165
'We were beaten and tortured
to say your name in this case'

1795
01:56:02,205 --> 01:56:04,745
As reported by IB
on January 24th

1796
01:56:05,495 --> 01:56:07,285
Forget Hotel International

1797
01:56:07,285 --> 01:56:09,165
Nambi Narayanan was
not even in Chennai

1798
01:56:09,205 --> 01:56:11,785
He was in Trivandrum
on that day in ISRO

1799
01:56:11,915 --> 01:56:14,075
'If you want you can check
the vehicle log books'

1800
01:56:14,495 --> 01:56:17,325
'All of them were tortured
and confessions were coerced'

1801
01:56:17,915 --> 01:56:20,285
Except for Nambi who withstood
all the torture meted to him

1802
01:56:20,665 --> 01:56:22,415
And till the end confessed nothing

1803
01:56:22,535 --> 01:56:24,495
'I visited Nambi's house to inquire, sir'

1804
01:56:25,075 --> 01:56:28,285
'Which by the way, IB and the Kerala police
have not bothered to do till date'

1805
01:56:29,165 --> 01:56:33,205
'This isn't the lifestyle of a man
who was offered 9 lakh US dollars'

1806
01:56:34,365 --> 01:56:35,915
So everybody else is lying?

1807
01:56:36,035 --> 01:56:37,745
And your father didn't
commit any crime

1808
01:56:37,785 --> 01:56:39,285
Do you believe he is innocent?

1809
01:56:44,285 --> 01:56:46,325
Sir, kindly step out

1810
01:56:46,535 --> 01:56:47,785
I need to talk to you

1811
01:56:47,865 --> 01:56:48,915
Please come

1812
01:56:49,455 --> 01:56:51,785
Come, sir
2 minutes

1813
01:56:54,165 --> 01:56:55,785
Leave right now, sir

1814
01:56:59,705 --> 01:57:02,165
Where have you come
and whom are you maligning?

1815
01:57:02,825 --> 01:57:04,825
What gall to deride my husband to ME!

1816
01:57:05,615 --> 01:57:06,825
I want you to leave, sir

1817
01:57:10,705 --> 01:57:12,865
It's a very self-respecting family, sir

1818
01:57:14,745 --> 01:57:17,915
I am suspicious of the time frame
this case has been foisted on Nambi

1819
01:57:18,825 --> 01:57:22,075
'Because here are two things that have
come to light from my visit to ISRO, sir'

1820
01:57:23,205 --> 01:57:24,205
One

1821
01:57:24,245 --> 01:57:28,285
45 days back, India launched
her first remote sensing satellite

1822
01:57:28,325 --> 01:57:29,915
And stupefied the world

1823
01:57:30,415 --> 01:57:33,535
Therefore in the multi-billion dollar
satellite launch market

1824
01:57:33,615 --> 01:57:35,785
India proved she is a powerful contender

1825
01:57:35,915 --> 01:57:36,915
Two

1826
01:57:36,955 --> 01:57:41,245
Only recently India imported from Russia
cryogenic technology and engines

1827
01:57:41,825 --> 01:57:44,205
Thereby enabling ISRO
in comparison to other agencies

1828
01:57:44,245 --> 01:57:46,245
...to launch satellites
at a much lower price

1829
01:57:46,995 --> 01:57:51,285
America tried its best to
stop this deal, come what may

1830
01:57:52,035 --> 01:57:54,075
What seems highly suspicious

1831
01:57:54,745 --> 01:57:59,285
3 men who were arrested were
working in the cryogenic department

1832
01:57:59,745 --> 01:58:01,365
Is this simply a coincidence?

1833
01:58:01,455 --> 01:58:02,995
Or our bigger concern is

1834
01:58:03,495 --> 01:58:06,665
To get ISRO completely out of
the commercial satellite market

1835
01:58:06,705 --> 01:58:09,075
And stop ISRO from competing at any cost

1836
01:58:09,205 --> 01:58:11,035
Was it a diabolical
well-planned conspiracy?

1837
01:58:12,035 --> 01:58:14,115
What is more cause for anxiety, Nair

1838
01:58:14,285 --> 01:58:17,785
If Nambi Narayanan, the man touted
to be the next director of ISRO

1839
01:58:17,995 --> 01:58:20,245
...is as innocent as you claim

1840
01:58:20,575 --> 01:58:23,075
Then who dragged his name into this case?

1841
01:58:23,245 --> 01:58:26,205
'Who is trying to destroy Nambi Narayanan?'

1842
01:58:50,115 --> 01:58:52,535
This incident forced you to be
imprisoned for 50 days

1843
01:58:52,575 --> 01:58:55,325
And the Maldivian women lost
2 years of their lives in jail

1844
01:58:56,035 --> 01:58:58,165
Top officer of Kerala police
was suspended

1845
01:58:58,285 --> 01:59:00,575
The Deputy Director of IB
who was in charge of this case

1846
01:59:00,745 --> 01:59:02,535
Retiring prematurely

1847
01:59:02,615 --> 01:59:04,575
And settled down
with his family in USA

1848
01:59:04,745 --> 01:59:07,365
And Chief Minister of Kerala
was dismissed from his seat of power

1849
01:59:07,535 --> 01:59:09,745
Many questions still remain unanswered

1850
01:59:10,115 --> 01:59:11,785
But the only silver lining of solace is

1851
01:59:12,245 --> 01:59:14,165
After numerous appearances in court

1852
01:59:14,205 --> 01:59:16,495
Enduring the torture
and 50 days in jail

1853
01:59:17,205 --> 01:59:18,995
You were finally granted bail

1854
01:59:19,415 --> 01:59:20,495
And you got your freedom

1855
01:59:23,495 --> 01:59:24,615
Is that 'solace'?

1856
02:00:07,205 --> 02:00:08,245
Please

1857
02:00:08,535 --> 02:00:10,665
Just wait here
Please understand

1858
02:00:11,245 --> 02:00:12,285
Please

1859
02:00:18,825 --> 02:00:19,825
Pa

1860
02:00:21,245 --> 02:00:22,415
Appa!

1861
02:00:34,705 --> 02:00:36,035
Where is Meena?

1862
02:00:42,495 --> 02:00:43,745
Where is she?

1863
02:00:47,115 --> 02:00:48,165
Huh?

1864
02:00:50,285 --> 02:00:51,455
Meena

1865
02:00:51,575 --> 02:00:54,575
She couldn't handle the brutal way
people treated her, appa

1866
02:00:54,665 --> 02:00:55,825
HUH?

1867
02:00:58,245 --> 02:00:59,455
Meena?

1868
02:01:05,415 --> 02:01:06,575
MEENA

1869
02:01:28,035 --> 02:01:29,245
Meena

1870
02:01:29,615 --> 02:01:30,615
Hey!

1871
02:01:35,285 --> 02:01:36,325
Meena

1872
02:01:37,785 --> 02:01:39,205
What is the matter, dear?

1873
02:01:42,365 --> 02:01:43,535
Meena...?

1874
02:01:45,075 --> 02:01:46,165
Hey!

1875
02:01:46,365 --> 02:01:47,535
I'm back

1876
02:01:48,745 --> 02:01:49,865
Look at me

1877
02:01:49,955 --> 02:01:51,165
I'm back home, dear

1878
02:01:59,825 --> 02:02:01,075
Aiyo!

1879
02:02:02,365 --> 02:02:03,865
'Shankar
Geetha...?'

1880
02:02:05,495 --> 02:02:07,285
Meena rushed out that way

1881
02:02:07,285 --> 02:02:08,325
Alright, pa

1882
02:02:08,995 --> 02:02:10,415
I'm fine, go check on her

1883
02:02:11,495 --> 02:02:19,495
"Who poisoned my milky white life
with such venomous spite and strife?"

1884
02:02:19,785 --> 02:02:25,035
"Who dispersed my dreams so lofty
that touched the skies high & mighty?"

1885
02:02:25,115 --> 02:02:27,415
[Malayalam] We need to take her
to a senior psychologist

1886
02:02:28,075 --> 02:02:30,915
She is in a state of deep shock
like she has seen a ghost

1887
02:02:32,705 --> 02:02:35,285
Sir, I don't think your wife
believes you are actually back

1888
02:02:35,415 --> 02:02:37,665
Don't worry
She will recover soon

1889
02:02:39,035 --> 02:02:46,615
"My heart yearns to beat no more
at this torturous twist to settle a score"

1890
02:02:48,325 --> 02:02:52,495
"Won't this be a nightmare
that will vanish into thin air?"

1891
02:02:53,365 --> 02:02:57,915
"Can't tomorrow bless and bring
a dawn with a new beginning?"

1892
02:02:58,205 --> 02:03:03,245
"Like a meteorite drilling a deep crater"

1893
02:03:03,245 --> 02:03:07,575
"My life has fallen into depths of despair"

1894
02:03:08,575 --> 02:03:13,915
"This pain is a torment unimaginable"

1895
02:03:17,705 --> 02:03:22,325
"My breath feels choked; indefinable"

1896
02:03:28,245 --> 02:03:36,245
"In this mirage that made no sense
I searched for my life's essence"

1897
02:03:36,535 --> 02:03:44,455
"I spent every minute of the day
like a walking corpse wasting away"

1898
02:03:47,455 --> 02:03:51,865
"Will this darkness dissolve
for clear skies to (r)evolve?"

1899
02:03:51,915 --> 02:03:56,665
"Will my life be a dead end
always sullied and stained?"

1900
02:03:58,245 --> 02:04:03,705
"Will my life once again bloom
dispelling this grief and gloom?"

1901
02:04:04,955 --> 02:04:10,035
"Can't this be a dream best forgotten
that will fade into oblivion?"

1902
02:04:10,245 --> 02:04:14,865
"Can't tomorrow envelop
a dawn of fresh hope?"

1903
02:04:14,915 --> 02:04:20,205
"Like a meteorite drilling a deep crater"

1904
02:04:20,285 --> 02:04:24,995
"My life has fallen into depths of despair"

1905
02:04:25,075 --> 02:04:30,745
"This pain is a torment unimaginable"

1906
02:04:33,825 --> 02:04:37,415
"My breath feels choked; indefinable"

1907
02:04:37,415 --> 02:04:39,745
'Although Nambi Narayanan is out on bail'

1908
02:04:39,745 --> 02:04:43,575
'It is unlikely he will be
reinstated in ISRO'

1909
02:04:44,785 --> 02:04:46,665
'As per the new case
Kerala police has filed-'

1910
02:04:46,705 --> 02:04:47,745
Narasimhan

1911
02:04:47,745 --> 02:04:49,035
Let's talk outside

1912
02:04:54,415 --> 02:04:56,165
Nambi, don't be silly

1913
02:04:56,665 --> 02:05:00,165
'They can't manufacture
an evidence and put you in jail'

1914
02:05:00,245 --> 02:05:03,115
Narasimhan, if I do go back to jail

1915
02:05:03,415 --> 02:05:05,825
I don't want my family
to be left in the lurch

1916
02:05:06,075 --> 02:05:08,955
As it is, they are going through hell

1917
02:05:10,705 --> 02:05:12,455
It has to be written someday

1918
02:05:47,865 --> 02:05:52,035
"Won't this be a nightmare
that will vanish into thin air?"

1919
02:05:53,205 --> 02:05:57,865
"Can't tomorrow bless and bring
a dawn with a new beginning?"

1920
02:05:58,035 --> 02:06:03,115
"Like a meteorite drilling a deep crater"

1921
02:06:03,115 --> 02:06:07,955
"My life has fallen into depths of despair"

1922
02:06:07,995 --> 02:06:13,825
"This pain is a torment unimaginable"

1923
02:06:16,915 --> 02:06:22,285
"My breath feels choked; indefinable"

1924
02:06:53,745 --> 02:06:54,825
'Appa'

1925
02:07:10,205 --> 02:07:13,865
I know for the past 6 months
you've been through hell

1926
02:07:14,365 --> 02:07:17,865
And we cannot even begin
to imagine all that you've faced

1927
02:07:19,665 --> 02:07:21,665
Do exactly what you want

1928
02:07:21,745 --> 02:07:24,785
Nobody can stop you and
we'll totally understand

1929
02:07:24,865 --> 02:07:26,365
But let me share two points

1930
02:07:26,415 --> 02:07:29,785
One, the need to prove
your innocence to the world

1931
02:07:29,865 --> 02:07:32,955
And the frenzy is embedded only in you

1932
02:07:32,955 --> 02:07:34,285
And secondly

1933
02:07:34,325 --> 02:07:36,615
God forbid, if something happens to you

1934
02:07:37,665 --> 02:07:40,915
This family will always be known
as traitors to the nation forever

1935
02:07:42,415 --> 02:07:45,245
And I don't think as a family
we'll be able to live with that either

1936
02:07:52,785 --> 02:07:53,995
By the way

1937
02:07:54,455 --> 02:07:56,705
Here's the will you asked
your lawyer to draft

1938
02:08:06,495 --> 02:08:07,575
Appa

1939
02:08:08,495 --> 02:08:09,955
Are we not better than this?

1940
02:08:22,535 --> 02:08:23,615
Arunan

1941
02:08:24,995 --> 02:08:26,865
Let's call the cryogenic department

1942
02:08:27,745 --> 02:08:29,365
I want to know what the progress is

1943
02:08:30,325 --> 02:08:32,035
'I want regular updates'

1944
02:08:32,415 --> 02:08:34,955
'If I get a chance to work
on this project again'

1945
02:08:35,825 --> 02:08:37,575
'I want to be completely prepared'

1946
02:08:54,865 --> 02:08:56,075
Why is it so empty?

1947
02:08:56,915 --> 02:09:00,245
After Rajashekaran, Surendran and you
were arrested, there was panic in the ranks

1948
02:09:00,285 --> 02:09:02,325
They opted for a transfer
to other departments

1949
02:09:03,115 --> 02:09:07,115
Few of them left Trivandrum
to join ISRO in other cities

1950
02:09:09,115 --> 02:09:10,325
How many are left?

1951
02:09:10,325 --> 02:09:11,455
A fraction!

1952
02:09:30,365 --> 02:09:31,415
How strange!

1953
02:09:31,955 --> 02:09:34,365
Why does it look like nobody
has been here for months, huh?

1954
02:09:44,415 --> 02:09:45,455
What are you looking for?

1955
02:09:45,495 --> 02:09:47,785
Where are the nozzle assembly kit
and the other engines?

1956
02:09:47,785 --> 02:09:50,495
- Nambi, they were never delivered
- What?!

1957
02:09:50,915 --> 02:09:53,205
'You were the single point
contact for this project'

1958
02:09:53,325 --> 02:09:55,785
Without you, the foundation collapsed!

1959
02:09:56,165 --> 02:09:57,455
Forget the 3rd consignment

1960
02:09:57,495 --> 02:09:59,865
Parts of the 2nd consignment
have still not been unloaded

1961
02:10:01,325 --> 02:10:03,995
'I am the one who told Arunan
not to tell you anything'

1962
02:10:08,705 --> 02:10:12,365
India was once the greatest nation
in the world for science and technology!

1963
02:10:12,415 --> 02:10:13,865
Who would believe it ?

1964
02:10:14,575 --> 02:10:15,785
Look at us now

1965
02:10:15,865 --> 02:10:17,825
Like a blind man riding a horse!

1966
02:10:18,915 --> 02:10:20,035
Yes

1967
02:10:21,035 --> 02:10:22,615
Someone rightly said

1968
02:10:23,365 --> 02:10:26,785
India never lost to her invaders

1969
02:10:26,825 --> 02:10:29,415
We sacrificed ourselves
with our own swords

1970
02:10:30,165 --> 02:10:32,035
And handed our nation
over to them on a platter

1971
02:10:32,245 --> 02:10:36,535
Begging and beseeching other nations for
technology and parts seems to be our fate

1972
02:10:36,865 --> 02:10:42,415
Every time we risk our lives and strive
we end up cutting our noses!

1973
02:10:43,165 --> 02:10:48,745
But, Param, other nations engage
our brilliant minds and overtake us

1974
02:10:48,825 --> 02:10:49,865
Listen

1975
02:10:50,075 --> 02:10:51,955
Why blame those who left?

1976
02:10:52,865 --> 02:10:56,035
Instead of focusing our intelligence
on research and earning name & fame

1977
02:10:56,165 --> 02:10:59,415
...who in his right mind will want to
be indulging in street fights like us?

1978
02:11:10,035 --> 02:11:12,035
Even if our scientists are being used

1979
02:11:12,115 --> 02:11:14,535
Still other nations do everything
internally, it is domestic

1980
02:11:15,035 --> 02:11:16,415
Totally indigenous

1981
02:11:21,245 --> 02:11:22,955
And that's exactly
what we need to do too

1982
02:11:23,415 --> 02:11:27,205
First we make our Vikas engine
completely indigenous

1983
02:11:27,785 --> 02:11:29,785
And then doesn't matter what it takes

1984
02:11:29,825 --> 02:11:32,665
We make our cryogenic engine
completely indigenous

1985
02:11:32,785 --> 02:11:33,915
Perfect!

1986
02:11:33,955 --> 02:11:35,955
That will only take us
another 20 years!

1987
02:11:36,035 --> 02:11:38,285
- Is that okay?
- So be it, so what?

1988
02:11:39,205 --> 02:11:41,245
At least things will be
at our own pace after that

1989
02:11:41,575 --> 02:11:43,785
More importantly,
we will have all the control

1990
02:11:44,455 --> 02:11:46,535
I'm afraid we don't have
any other choice, Mr Unni

1991
02:11:53,865 --> 02:11:56,665
What if I tell you, we can make
the world turn speechless in amazement?

1992
02:11:56,705 --> 02:11:59,165
That I have the mother
of all indigenous ideas

1993
02:11:59,365 --> 02:12:00,575
Will you believe me?

1994
02:12:05,285 --> 02:12:06,285
What?

1995
02:12:06,535 --> 02:12:07,865
The Mars Mission

1996
02:12:08,415 --> 02:12:10,745
What if I tell you that if we focus
on indigenous production

1997
02:12:10,785 --> 02:12:16,035
We can achieve this mission at a fraction
of what other agencies have spent on it

1998
02:12:16,075 --> 02:12:17,495
Are you prepared to believe me?

1999
02:12:18,165 --> 02:12:19,165
Mr Genius

2000
02:12:19,165 --> 02:12:23,495
We just concluded we won't have
cryogenic engines for the next 20 years!

2001
02:12:24,115 --> 02:12:25,745
You were here, right?

2002
02:12:25,785 --> 02:12:27,705
What if I tell you,
to succeed in Mars Mission

2003
02:12:27,745 --> 02:12:30,455
We do NOT need a cryogenic engine
will you believe me?

2004
02:12:31,705 --> 02:12:35,245
We can just do it with
solid and liquid engines

2005
02:12:35,955 --> 02:12:37,415
I firmly believe so

2006
02:12:37,705 --> 02:12:38,955
It is 100% possible

2007
02:12:43,245 --> 02:12:45,115
Not telling us this earlier,
what if I tell you

2008
02:12:45,165 --> 02:12:47,535
I want to launch a rocket up
your ass, will you believe me?!

2009
02:12:50,995 --> 02:12:53,115
5-4-3

2010
02:13:00,785 --> 02:13:03,245
You know how ridiculous
and eccentric you sound, right?

2011
02:13:04,615 --> 02:13:06,075
Is that so?

2012
02:13:06,165 --> 02:13:09,455
Uncle, being the 'king of eccentricity'
how can this be new to you?

2013
02:13:11,115 --> 02:13:13,165
While ISRO was still
floundering with solids

2014
02:13:13,205 --> 02:13:15,995
...when you wanted to pursue liquids
it was eccentric to say the least

2015
02:13:16,285 --> 02:13:19,785
Asking for £400 million worth
of equipment for free in Scotland?

2016
02:13:19,955 --> 02:13:20,995
Bizarre!

2017
02:13:21,285 --> 02:13:23,115
Carting our scientists to France

2018
02:13:23,165 --> 02:13:25,785
And ending up building a better engine
than the French themselves?

2019
02:13:25,785 --> 02:13:29,455
Smuggling the cryogenic engine from Russia
from under the nose of Americans?

2020
02:13:31,165 --> 02:13:34,115
Uncle, if anybody should understand
the power of being eccentric

2021
02:13:34,115 --> 02:13:35,325
...who else but you?

2022
02:13:36,415 --> 02:13:37,705
So why stop now?

2023
02:13:40,325 --> 02:13:41,365
Okay

2024
02:13:42,365 --> 02:13:43,745
What do you have in mind?

2025
02:13:45,286 --> 02:13:47,786
So what if we don't have
the cryogenic engine?

2026
02:13:48,665 --> 02:13:51,415
Our Vikas engine runs for 180 seconds

2027
02:13:52,035 --> 02:13:56,535
So if the Vikas engine can be increased
to enhance thrust, that will do

2028
02:13:56,995 --> 02:13:58,245
I swear, trust me

2029
02:13:58,915 --> 02:14:01,165
We can launch a satellite around Mars

2030
02:14:01,615 --> 02:14:04,285
That too, as indigenous as it can get!

2031
02:14:09,915 --> 02:14:11,245
With our Indian Almanac!

2032
02:14:15,415 --> 02:14:16,455

We accomplished the near impossible
in the very first attempt

What an achievement, sir

2040
02:14:40,165 --> 02:14:43,825
But during that period
you were under severe duress

2041
02:14:44,745 --> 02:14:47,825
On one side you had to save your job
you regarded as your heartbeat

2042
02:14:48,665 --> 02:14:51,535
And the other, a fight
to prove your innocence

2043
02:14:51,575 --> 02:14:53,455
You were fighting this singlehanded

2044
02:14:54,825 --> 02:14:59,205
4 years, 75 court hearings,
3 lawyers, 5 petitions

And the millions spent

2046
02:15:01,575 --> 02:15:04,575
It would have taken a huge toll
on you and your family for sure

Supreme court cleared your name
and pronounced your innocence

2119
02:20:37,115 --> 02:20:39,495
If it is decided to pelt a dog and kill it

2120
02:20:40,615 --> 02:20:42,665
...all that is required is to
label it a rabid dog!

2121
02:20:44,955 --> 02:20:46,915
In the same way
the intention was to

...prevent you from
holding your head high

2123
02:20:51,915 --> 02:20:54,285
Defaming you as a traitor
will do the trick

2124
02:20:57,325 --> 02:20:58,865
That's the reward you got!

2125

The despair and distress
brought about by this case

2126
02:21:03,035 --> 02:21:05,245
Even 24 years later
your wife is still traumatized

2127
02:21:05,285 --> 02:21:06,495
And hasn't recovered

2128
02:21:11,165 --> 02:21:13,415
You have paid a heavy price for it

2129
02:21:14,165 --> 02:21:16,745
You sued for a sum of
10 million as compensation

2130
02:21:17,285 --> 02:21:19,035
But more than a decade later

2131
02:21:19,915 --> 02:21:22,035
You have been granted only 1 million!

2132
02:21:23,165 --> 02:21:25,035
Is this compensation
of any value to you?

2133

Do you think so?

2134

I may be too old, weak and senile
to spend or enjoy all that money, Mr Suriya

2136
02:21:41,825 --> 02:21:45,415
But I want every single paisa
of that compensation

2137
02:21:47,205 --> 02:21:49,325
Because unless I get that money

2138
02:21:49,705 --> 02:21:53,365
The sword of suspicion hanging
as 'traitor' over my family won't vanish

2139
02:21:56,915 --> 02:21:59,535
And after sacrificing all this,
I will not allow that infamy

2140
02:22:05,245 --> 02:22:07,285
I am not fighting this only for myself

2141
02:22:09,865 --> 02:22:11,705
How many people like me in this nation?

2142

How many, Mr Suriya?

02:22:18,955 --> 02:22:20,915
Those punished for being a patriot-

2144
02:22:24,665 --> 02:22:26,035
I must fight for their cause

2145
02:22:29,915 --> 02:22:31,575
I will fight till my last breath

2146
02:22:35,495 --> 02:22:36,575
I will fight

2147
02:23:28,995 --> 02:23:30,575
To offer words of solace

2148
02:23:32,115 --> 02:23:33,365
I'm totally at a loss

2149
02:23:37,915 --> 02:23:39,205
Not as an actor or hero

2150
02:23:40,995 --> 02:23:42,745
As an ordinary citizen

2151
02:23:43,665 --> 02:23:44,865
As a human being

2152
02:23:45,995 --> 02:23:47,325
I want to do this for you

2153
02:23:49,415 --> 02:23:51,745
To do this on behalf of our entire nation

2154
02:23:52,705 --> 02:23:55,285
I don't know if I have
the right or eligibility

2155
02:23:56,615 --> 02:23:58,245
But I can't be without doing this

2156
02:24:06,205 --> 02:24:07,245
Nambi, sir

2157
02:24:09,205 --> 02:24:10,575
On behalf of our people

2158
02:24:11,575 --> 02:24:12,745
I ask forgiveness

2159
02:24:15,455 --> 02:24:17,455
For the way we treated you

2160
02:24:19,325 --> 02:24:22,825
For all the due honors
we did not shower on you

2161
02:24:24,825 --> 02:24:26,285
I ask forgiveness
for everything

2162
02:24:29,365 --> 02:24:30,615
Please forgive us

2163
02:24:42,955 --> 02:24:45,165
Sir, I understand your good intentions

2164
02:24:45,205 --> 02:24:46,865
And I am grateful for it

2165
02:24:47,495 --> 02:24:49,285
But please don't make
this grand apology

2166
02:24:50,665 --> 02:24:53,495
If you offer an apology
ever so magnanimously

2167
02:24:53,955 --> 02:24:55,165
And I accept it

2168
02:24:55,455 --> 02:24:57,575
It will create a false sense of closure

2169
02:24:57,825 --> 02:24:59,415
But it doesn't fix or change anything

2170
02:24:59,785 --> 02:25:02,955
I can't come to terms with that
and so I cannot accept your apology

2171
02:25:04,455 --> 02:25:05,705
Mr Suriya

2172
02:25:06,615 --> 02:25:08,035
If I am innocent

2173
02:25:08,165 --> 02:25:09,665
Then isn't somebody else guilty?

2174
02:25:09,665 --> 02:25:11,115
The question is 'who'?

2175
02:25:11,705 --> 02:25:14,115
A befitting answer has to be found
for this question of mine

2176
02:25:14,955 --> 02:25:18,915
If those who have dedicated
their lives for their nation's progress

2177
02:25:18,915 --> 02:25:20,705
...are not respected or cherished

2178
02:25:20,745 --> 02:25:23,955
No such nation has become
a superpower in our annals of history

2179
02:25:24,575 --> 02:25:25,785
At the same time

May be a few would have tried to
destroy me with that spy case

2181

I have complete faith in

Anyway

Unable to go around.

I said we have
a fuel emergency. Goddammit!

I say again, Deccan Air 582...

10
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,658
I'm running out of fuel.
Let me land!

11
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,060
There's something's wrong.
They are ignoring protocol.

You're not cleared to land!

-Why aren't you letting them land?
-Who are you? Guards!

Maara, what's going on there?

-Why won't they let us land?
-Do you copy?

Tambaram Air Force. Runway 1-5.

18
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,976
Land there!
Do you have enough fuel for that?

19
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,211
We've enough for one landing!

20
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:26,313
-You sure you want us to proceed?
-I'm sure!

21
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,615
-We'll be in trouble.
-Land at Tambaram, damn it!

-You can't land here, Captain.

His relatives say he's unemployed now.

-It's unprecedented.

It's unheard of for a girl's family
to visit a boy.

He refused to see you!
Why are you dying to see him?

Good question.

He refused to treat me

Am I really spoilt?

-You're the spoilt brat, not me.
-Ask her to shut up, Dad.

Listen, girl,

00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:38,131
Daughters move in with their
husbands after marriage and enjoy life.

Are we that repulsive to you?

00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:03,156
We get off at Sholavandhan.
Then these seats will be all yours.

82
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,393
This is an express train.
Won't stop at Sholavandhan.

83
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:10,497
It will! For the last six months,
my dear Maara

84
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,467
didn't let any train pass
without stopping at Sholavandhan.

85
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:17,271
They had no choice but to stop here!

86
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,774
So, every time I go to Madurai
I'll have to endure this stench.

87

Mister, you can keep these
seats for yourself!

88
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,446
We won't be commuting
in trains anymore.

00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,879
When his eyelids last shut,
He is but a procession on hearse.

Fill up the cauldron with bubbling booze!

100

Stomp and shake
At our dear man's final walk!

101

Rich or poor,
All are dealt the same notch!

102

All get blown the conch!

Rich or poor,
All are dealt the same notch!

On their final passage,
All get blown the conch!

105
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:45,092
All that he can take when dead
Is the rupee-coin on his forehead!

106
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,562
That one rupee coin!

107
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:54,201
That one rupee coin!
That and that alone!

108
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,938
All that he can take when dead
Is the rupee-coin on his forehead!

00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:01,408
Let us beat and dance
To make even the dead prance!

110
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:05,078
Women will wail only till the streets end!

111

As the pyre burns, the rib cage yearns!

112
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:12,085
Legions of near and dear,
Yet no one to tag along with him!

113
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:15,589
Acres of lands were his,
Yet six feet of soil is what is!

114
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:19,293
Legions of near and dear,
Yet no one to tag along with him!

115

Acres of lands were his,
Yet six feet of soil is what is!

116
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,068
The one dancing
in black shirt is the groom.

117
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,770
Is he the groom?

118
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:31,705
-Look how the groom is dancing!
-Maara!

119
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:35,142
-The bride's family is here.
-What is he saying?

120
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:37,110
Our community will humiliate us,
if they see this!

121
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,612
They're watching you, man!

122
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,214
Who cares?

123
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,115
That man danced for every death here.

124
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,952
The whole village
should be dancing for him!

125
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,921
-Come and dance!
-That's right!

126
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,600
-God forbid she starts dancing!
-Stop.

127
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,002
Hey, come.

128
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,180
Rocks! Palm trees!

129
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:16,416
-Barren lands!
-Everything is for your daughter!

130
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:19,353
Yeah, right! The groom doesn't seem
interested in the marriage.

131
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,622
Oh, no! He's keen too!

132
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,957
Your girl is lucky! Please come.

133
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,626
Please have some fryums.

134
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,030
We didn't come
all the way to eat fryums.

135
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:32,032
Don't you have cakes?

136
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,036
There's not even a toilet here
and you want cakes!

137
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,571
Don't shush me.
It's the truth

138
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,873
Hey! Since we're talking truths,

139
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,408
I'm completely broke.

140
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,311
I've a huge loan
and all I earn goes for repayment.

141
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,813
The government took our fertile lands

142
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,249
for a dam and gave us these barren lands.
Isn't that, right?

143
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,018
All I have is

144
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,986
an idea to start an airline.

145
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,855
But that too
has been rejected by 24 banks.

146
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:55,989
Look, mister.

147
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:59,226
Men are in a queue to marry
my beautiful and talented daughter.

148
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,628
I've been rejected by 20 grooms so far.

149
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,764
-Silly girl. Shut up!
-Why are you shushing?

150
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:09,903
I don't sew, cook, dance or sing!

151
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,040
Mr. Military! She's just pulling your leg.

152
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,242
-She knows all that and more. Right?
-Yes,

153
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,410
but I won't do any of it.

154
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:18,212
All I want to do is start a bakery.

155
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,049
All this brutal honesty can be tiring.

156
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,751
-Let's eat.
-Let's go!

157
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,854
-Come, let's go...
-Wait.

158
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,591
It's not our tradition to eat unless
the discussion is fruitful.

159
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,727
And we don't let our guests go hungry.

160
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,462
-Let's eat.
-Hey!

161
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,235
So your friend's bringing planes here?

162
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,736
Yeah, bro!

163
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,171
Have you been in an airplane?

164
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:46,840
"Been in one"? I've flown one!

165
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,076
When my pilot friend drives

166
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,746
he hands me the steering
when he smokes.

167
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,282
What? It's true, bro!

168
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:56,550
Give them water to drink.

169
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:58,085
How will you finance your airline?

170
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,288
Hey, that's grown-up talk.
Why are you asking about it?

171
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,623
That's exactly why I'm asking.

172
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,458
Quite the shrewd kid!

173
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,727
So, 20 boys rejected you?

174
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,598
Twenty-four banks rejected you.
Let's talk about that first.

175
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,535
-They weren't that bright.
-Those men weren't either.

176
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:15,836
Be quiet and eat!

177
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,238
One, two, three...

178
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:21,909
Just three steps to start an airline!
Seems simple.

179
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,778
Starting a bakery must be even simpler.

180
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,446
Why haven't you done that yet?

181
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,081
I'm still on step one.

182
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:31,451
Looking for finance.
I'm waiting to get the money.

183
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:37,291
I know what a bank is.
What is Ven-tu-re Capitalists?

184
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,492
Venture Capitalists.

185
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:42,296
Banks give loans against collateral.

186
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,631
But for Venture Capitalist, VC

187
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,333
your idea is your collateral.

188
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,669
You get funds if they like your idea.

189
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,573
Then you should catch a VC.

190
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:53,841
Who is that? VC?

191
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,011
Paresh Goswami.

192
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,746
The owner of Jaz Airlines.

193
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:04,284
He realized his dream
with little to no help. My hero.

194
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:09,022
With so many basic needs unfulfilled
in our country

195
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,691
who needs planes?

196
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:14,194
A century ago,
they said we don't need electricity.

197
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,496
Fifty years ago,
they said we don't need cars.

198
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,798
Who decides that?

199
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,633
The rich decide for the rest.

200
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,870
-Keep quiet. You won't understand.
-Smart girl.

201
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:24,671
Okay.

202
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:26,940
Okay with what?

203
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,376
I'm okay marrying you.

204
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:34,948
That was quick.
Are you insane?

205
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:39,453
Sometimes, no matter how hard we think,
we end up doing what we want.

206
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:41,722
-Why waste time?
-That's Maara!

207
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,892
But I give enough thought
before making up my mind.

208
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:45,926
There she goes.

209
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,060
I'll tell you tomorrow.

210
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,864
That's my girl. Eat, dear.

211
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,041
He fussed about eating here,

212
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,544
now he missed the train
and has to stay the night!

213
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:04,645
Destiny!

214
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:15,022
That way.

215
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:20,994
Hey!

216
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,865
You have a big house in the village.

217
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,768
Why do you stay here without electricity?

218
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,436
Getting electricity is no big deal.

219
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,406
Even teacher Rajangam's house
didn't have electricity 20 years ago.

220
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:33,473
I don't go there anymore.

221
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,375
Air... Air India!

222
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:36,577
Where are you going?

223
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,245
I'm going in Air India, Dad!

224
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,447
You want planes when there are no roads?

225
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:41,982
First, learn to cut hair!

226
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,852
Is it a law that a son must follow
his father's trade?

227
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,888
No matter what they study,

228
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,357
it's their fate
to get into the family business.

229
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:53,961
Keep the pot on your head, kid,
I'll do the rest in the morning.

230
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,696
Dad, it would look awkward!

231
00:14:55,796 --> 00:14:57,598
What if I cut off your ear in the dark?

232
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,466
First bring trains to our village!

233
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:02,202
It's really hard for us
to commute, you know.

234
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,806
My father, the six-fingered
school teacher,

235
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:09,309
wrote numerous letters to the government
to make the train stop here.

236
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,478
How long will you keep writing?

237
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:13,647
As long as I can hold a pen.

238
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:17,584
Politicians go around happily
in trains and planes!

239
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:20,220
Why would they care about us?

240
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:24,992
The teacher kept writing petitions,
but nothing changed.

241
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,026
I picked up a stone.

242
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,996
-Hear us, Central Government!
-[all] Hear us, Central Government!

243
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,565
-Stop the express train here!
-[all] Stop the express train here!

244
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:32,733
-Deceive us, no more!
-[train horn blaring]

245
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,568
[all] Deceive us, no more!

246
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,670
[all clamoring]

247
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,939
Down with police brutality!

248
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,941
Deceive us, no more!

249
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,243
We want the train!

250
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,779
We want the train!

251
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,482
[people clamoring]

252
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:51,151
Maara!

253
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:52,853
Kaali!

254
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,254
-Kaali...
-Maara!

255
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:56,223
Maara!

256
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,258
Lift him up!

257
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:02,162
-I can't open my eye, Maara!
-Lift him up!

258
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:06,466
What happened?
Oh, my God! You're bleeding!

259
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:10,537
Your son pelted stones
to stop the train at Sholavandhan.

260
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,941
Esakki's son got hurt,
he could've lost an eye!

261
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,211
My God! He got hurt in the eye!
Come in!

262
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:21,448
Esakki kept quiet because it was my son.

263
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,786
But, God, the way he looked at me...

264
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:27,554
It killed me.

265
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:30,090
I preach non-violence to everyone,

266
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,560
but my own son doesn't listen to me.

267
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:36,163
Dad! You've always said time is precious.

268
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:39,566
And that the train stopping here
will change our lives!

269
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,236
This is how things change!

270
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,838
There's no need to do good
by destroying yourself.

271
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:47,608
Aren't you educated?
You're a teacher's son, not a rogue.

272
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:51,778
If you want to stop the train,
you write to the division head.

273
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,248
Did you do that?

274
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,450
-You wrote petitions. Did anything happen?
-Maara...

275
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:59,486
We got electricity because of that.
Get inside, Maara!

276
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:00,754
Not that petition, Mom!

277
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,590
I know which petition he's talking about.
Let him talk.

278
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:06,527
Listen, he hasn't eaten yet!

279
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,161
You know he blabbers when he's hungry!

280
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:12,799
-Come in...
-If he has the guts, let him say it!

281
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,169
First thing tomorrow,
I'll have him arrested.

282
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,171
Don't say that. He's our son!

283
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:19,439
What did you do
when mom had pregnancy complications?

284
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:22,576
You just sent petitions
asking for a medical camp!

285
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,911
You'll have me arrested?

286
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,113
You should be arrested
for killing my sister.

287
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,848
-Maara! No...
-Quiet, Mom!

288
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:29,950
We had to take Kaali
to the hospital outside the town!

289
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,585
This armchair idealist

290
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:33,554
will bury us all with his petitions!

291
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,123
You're a bloody failure!
And will always be one!

292
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,859
Please, no!

293
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:40,327
Maara, please come in...

294
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,895
If violence is wrong,

295
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:43,897
why the fuck did you just hit me?

296
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:52,005
Thanks for the respect, son.

297
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:56,577
Don't even light my pyre
when I die. Leave!

298
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,513
What have you done?

299
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,315
What have you done? Maara!

300
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:04,418
Maara... Stop!

301
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,386
He's leaving! Maara!

302
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,822
Maara! Where are you going? Wait!

303
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:11,725
And then?

304
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,963
Then I joined the National Defense Academy
and then the Air Force.

305
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,265
Quite the angry man!

306
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,000
Were you as bad in the Air Force?

307
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:26,240
[planes whooshing]

308
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:37,951
He says the snacks don’t reach him.

309
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:39,987
-All the postal guys...
-Ma!

310
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:41,989
[softly] Show it to him.

311
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,724
The postal guys eat them up.

312
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,759
-Maara has sent a letter.
-I'm sending two boxes this time

313
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:47,895
with a note saying,

314
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,265
"You can take one box,
but give the other to my son."

315
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,533
Hey! Who told you to go there?
Get it here!

316
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,967
Should I read it to you?

317
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:57,304
I am a third grader,
and a teacher's wife!

318
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:58,839
I can read myself.

319
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:00,407
Look at him writing chits.

320
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,744
Writing letters for his son
and then hiding them!

321
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:05,679
I will shred them all one day!

322
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,314
Dear, Mom...

323
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:09,516
[softly] Look! He's listening.

324
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,653
And dear, Kaali,

325
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:14,421
how are you?

326
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,323
I'm good here."

327
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,659
This shows how much he loves us.

328
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,595
I passed my ex-cams, Mom.

329
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,964
-It's "exam," ma!
-That's what I said. Shut up!

330
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:26,233
Che secured first spot.

331
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,903
And I was second. Seby stood fourth.

332
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:35,442
I am Pilot officer
Nedumaaran Rajangam now."

333
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:58,365
There is an officer called Naidu,
who torments me with his rules

334
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:04,438
and tortures me with dos and don'ts
just like our teacher!"

335
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:07,007
Bring this stupid Naidu to me.

336
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,843
I'm going to break his neck
like I do with chickens.

337
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,413
Move round and round
Like a surging hurricane!

338
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:17,251
Lunge far and wide
Like a bull off its leash!

339
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,957
Keep the act alive! Rock the damn house!

340
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:27,895
Like the blazing sun,
Set your path on fire!

341
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:29,663
Sir!

342
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,509
Come on, trainees! Double up!

343
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,977
Move fast, I say!

344
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:47,481
-Maara? How are you?
-I'm fine, Kaali! How are you?

345
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,249
-Where is mom?
-She's fine!

346
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:51,818
Get her quick! I only have three minutes!

347
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:54,254
She's bringing your father!

348
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:56,723
She'll be here any second!
Hang on! Maara...

349
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,158
She's here!

350
00:20:58,225 --> 00:20:59,159
Hurry up!

351
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:00,928
-Come soon!
-Ask them to hurry!

352
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:04,598
He can't walk fast, you know.

353
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:05,699
-Here.
-Yeah.

354
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,434
Hello, Maara?

355
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:10,737
-Mom?
-Maara? Your dad has come.

356
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:13,640
-Mom...-Shall I put him on?

357
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,576
-Mom, I can hear you.
-Maara?

358
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:16,844
I can't hear anything.

359
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,111
I can hear you! Please talk!

360
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:19,413
Maara! Hello?

361
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,048
I can hear you! Tell mom to speak.

362
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,549
Give it to dad!

363
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,451
-The line got disconnected!
-Oh, no!

364
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:27,020
I can hear you, Kaali.
Put dad on the line!

365
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:29,623
Why will he talk to a loser?

366
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:32,192
He won't talk to me.

367
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:33,627
-What?
-He won't talk to me.

368
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:35,896
-Hold him!
-I hear you, Dad! Mom!

369
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,031
-I'll just make one more call!
-Hold him carefully!

370
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:38,765
Appa...

371
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:40,534
-Nedumaaran.
-Sir!

372
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:41,902
People are waiting.

373
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:43,670
Everyone gets only three minutes.

374
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,138
Call next month! Move.

375
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:46,540
Move!

376
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:54,181
Logistically, we can save a lot, sir.

377
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:56,149
How will one Mi-26 alone suffice?

378
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:57,751
This being a joint operation
with the army,

379
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:00,020
we can transport airmen
in their armored troop carriers.

380
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:01,321
One chopper will do.

381
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:03,323
We can ration fuel
and cut down extra costs...

382
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,659
You will cut down nothing, Nedumaaran.

383
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,160
Don't be stingy.

384
00:22:07,294 --> 00:22:08,795
Intelligence says
insurgent activity has risen

385
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:11,265
in the Narsapuram forests.

386
00:22:11,365 --> 00:22:13,867
We eliminate risk by increasing
our ground numbers.

387
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,136
I'm not being stingy,
I'm being smart, sir.

388
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:19,373
-So... Chaitanya!
-Sir!

389
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,742
-Is he saying I am not smart?
-No, sir!

390
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:26,880
Fifty rounds around the parade ground!

391
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:29,016
Fifty kilos dead weight!

392
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:31,118
Take your pals with you!

393
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:35,289
Hundred rounds, 80 kilos,
in one and half hours!

394
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,456
Move!

395
00:22:57,678 --> 00:22:58,745
Where the hell did she go?

396
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:00,380
We missed our last train
because of her...

397
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:02,316
-Hey!
-Sundari!

398
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:06,854
What are you doing with him
so late at night?

399
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:12,593
He lost his heart to this cunning belle!

400
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:18,065
Into the curve of her bangle,
Trapped, he fell!

401
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:24,137
She pulled off one hell of a heist
And took off into the night!

402
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:30,177
Many, many clouds jumped from the skies
To catch her stride with their eyes!

403
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:31,445
You brigand!

404
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,015
Oh, you brigand!

405
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,118
Left behind an everlasting mark!

406
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:40,954
She's gonna be trouble!

407
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:44,124
-Hey, Kaali!
-Yes, buddy?

408
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,027
I'll kill you!

409
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,898
Why is she ranting?
You two were just talking, right?

410
00:23:50,964 --> 00:23:52,766
Why? Should I tell you everything?

411
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:56,570
After so many rejections,

412
00:23:56,703 --> 00:24:00,807
I was scared my niece
will remain a spinster.

413
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:04,144
This is auspicious month.
Got to book a marriage hall soon!

414
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:05,579
Marriage hall?

415
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:28,001
The groom looks dashing!

416
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,674
No!

417
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,709
What the hell?

418
00:24:35,843 --> 00:24:38,111
Are you saying no to the marriage hall?

419
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:39,646
I am saying no to the marriage.

420
00:24:40,113 --> 00:24:42,850
The boy himself has agreed!
Why are you rejecting?

421
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:45,085
Did you ask the 20 men
why they rejected me?

422
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:46,286
-That's different!
-Shut up.

423
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:48,222
-Keep quiet.
-She said no.

424
00:24:48,422 --> 00:24:49,356
May I ask why?

425
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:51,191
Yes! Yes, you may!

426
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:53,660
You're already married

427
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:55,028
to your planes!

428
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:56,563
I'm married, too.

429
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,600
Let's make something out of that first.

430
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:04,171
Serves you right for your arrogance.
A devil just like you!

431
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:07,241
No loss, buddy!
She already looks like a bun,

432
00:25:07,307 --> 00:25:09,009
we can find someone better than her.

433
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:12,012
You calm down!
I'm sure she has her reasons.

434
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,113
Is this needed?

435
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,148
Hey, broker. I'll deal with you later.

436
00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:17,684
Broker! Is this what you do all the time?

437
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:19,720
You brought us all the way here to say no?

438
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,623
What is your problem?
That I rejected him

439
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:25,058
Or that you couldn't reject your husband?

440
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,562
-Drop them.
-I don't want to drive them!

441
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:29,997
Let them walk!

442
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:34,168
It's a waste of fuel.
Hey, get into the vehicle.

443
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:41,708
This pristine belle leaves this soil
With my heart in tow!

444
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:47,047
With her snarky words,
This enchantress traps me now!

445
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:53,053
One gaze of hers and I fall apart!

446
00:25:53,153 --> 00:25:59,026
In the blink of an eye,
She left me a blubbering mess!

447
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:05,832
Why laugh after tearing me
To shreds, you fiend?

448
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:10,304
You've knotted me up
In the curve of your hip!

449
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,539
Your two eyes

450
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:13,841
BOMMI BAKERY

451
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:18,879
Pin me down!

452
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:29,723
Why laugh after tearing me
To shreds, you fiend?

453
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:35,762
You've knotted me up
In the curve of your hip...

454
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:39,032
-We cannot give loans for airplanes.
-The idea...

455
00:26:39,132 --> 00:26:41,435
You know we are a tiny rural bank.

456
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:44,471
Morning, ma'am.
May I meet Mr. Mittal.

457
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:46,740
-I am Nedumaaran...
-I have many of these already, sir.

458
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:04,658
With your husky voice, you stole my heart!

459
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:10,631
You set ablaze this beetle
Burrowing an electric pole!

460
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:17,638
You threw my heart into complete disarray!

461
00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:22,676
You flashed a smile into the darkness
To give birth to the dawn!

462
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:25,612
She came by like fire!

463
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:28,182
My head splits
Into a million sweet smithereens!

464
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:33,921
Will this refreshing drink
Be my forever fate?

465
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:41,628
Why laugh after tearing me
To shreds, you fiend?

466
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:47,634
You've knotted me up
In the curve of your hip!

467
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:49,937
I can't meet anyone right now. I'm late.

468
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:52,606
Sir...

469
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,811
Ma'am, one meeting with Mr. Paresh.

470
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:01,281
You always make these fritters,

471
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:03,217
why can't you make cakes?

472
00:28:03,383 --> 00:28:06,053
Look at the mugs wanting cakes!

473
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,888
Bommi Cakes!

474
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:11,725
Sweet news for the sweet-toothed!

475
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,060
Mr. Paresh Goswami...

476
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:15,696
Look! I already have 100 of your cards!

477
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:17,764
You can't meet him.
Why don't you understand?

478
00:28:38,252 --> 00:28:40,754
You sound more like a fortune teller
than a programmer!

479
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:42,523
The logic is wrong. Override this.

480
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:44,324
-Yeah, try that.
-It's running, sir!

481
00:28:44,424 --> 00:28:46,059
Source code ready! Brilliant, sir!

482
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:47,661
It's working, sir! Brilliant, sir!

483
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:49,329
Yes, he is.

484
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:51,598
How many millions
did you make from this?

485
00:28:51,698 --> 00:28:53,433
Corrupting IIT kids with his lofty ideas!

486
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,370
You should've become
a professor at IIT, sir.

487
00:28:56,503 --> 00:28:59,506
-Yes, sir! You should!
-Yes, sir!

488
00:28:59,606 --> 00:29:02,109
If I was really that smart,
I would've moved out of here.

489
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:08,549
The two of you quit the Air Force
yapping about some big dreams.

490
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:09,850
But you accomplished nothing.

491
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,118
Son-in-law! Sebastian!

492
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:13,086
You need an ex-servicemen loan, right?

493
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:15,522
No one respects him out there.

494
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:18,692
Especially, now with Naidu
sitting in Tambaram.

495
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:20,661
-He won't sign.
-I can't hear you!

496
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:24,097
How can you, if you’re stuffed
to your gills with my food?

497
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:24,932
Of course, you won't.

498
00:29:24,998 --> 00:29:25,999
Thank you, sir.

499
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:29,870
This loan won't be approved
without Naidu's nod.

500
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,738
Be quiet when we get there, alright?

501
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:34,308
Che's gone through a lot
to get us this appointment.

502
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:37,277
-So, you shut up! Understand?
-Mmm.

503
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:39,279
Do you get it or not?

504
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:41,615
-I got it!
-Good boy! Go!

505
00:29:45,252 --> 00:29:46,253
Nedumaaran,

506
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:48,589
let me spell it out for you.

507
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:52,993
Even though I can,
I won't sign these referral papers.

508
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:59,132
You want my best pilot Chaitanya resign
and ruin his life.

509
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:01,168
I don't like people who break rules.

510
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,536
You are not fit to be a leader!

511
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,837
Let's go!

512
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:07,241
Sir.

513
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,779
Seby? Maara? Boys, what happened?

514
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:15,282
The same crap after all these years.

515
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:17,351
-Egoistic jackasses, both!
-Maara, stop!

516
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:20,654
Forget him and the banks!
Let's figure out our next move!

517
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:21,989
I just did!

518
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:23,123
-Hold on, Maara!
-Maara!

519
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,661
-Twenty-thousand rupees, yes?
-Yes.

520
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:29,463
-Have a nice journey.
-Thank you.

521
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,698
-Ma'am, please check those in.
-Please consider my request.

522
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:35,169
I've just two boxes of fryums and pickles.

523
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:37,471
-They'll be ruined if I check them in!
-Ma'am, that's not my problem.

524
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:39,273
-You're delaying the passengers.
-My sister's pregnant...

525
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,407
Sir, please come forward.

526
00:30:40,474 --> 00:30:41,909
Do you know anything about
pregnancy cravings?

527
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:44,378
Of course not, 'cause you're a man!

528
00:30:44,478 --> 00:30:47,014
-Have you ever been pregnant?
-Send the manager to counter 4.

529
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,382
Yeah, call the manager!

530
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:51,151
-If that's a lady, she'll understand.
-Excuse me, ma'am.

531
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:52,719
I'll take it. No problem.

532
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:55,556
-I got this.
-Thank you very much, sir.

533
00:30:55,722 --> 00:30:57,958
He is with me. Check me in now!

534
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:00,027
-Check me in! Yeah!
-Sure, ma'am.

535
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,462
You won't run away with these, right?

536
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:04,031
Fryums and pickles.

537
00:31:04,164 --> 00:31:05,199
Are you a reporter?

538
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:06,700
How did you guess?

539
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:08,468
You ask too many questions.

540
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:12,005
This flight is full of media people.

541
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:16,410
Paresh Goswami himself is flying us
to the RRTV Awards.

542
00:31:16,476 --> 00:31:18,412
-Is that where you are going?
-Yes.

543
00:31:18,812 --> 00:31:21,315
-But I've not seen you in media before.
-Your boarding pass, ma'am?

544
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:24,384
I'm Chitra Ramaswamy.
Senior Producer, All India Radio.

545
00:31:25,485 --> 00:31:26,820
Why are you going?

546
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:28,555
Sir.

547
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:31,592
Am I bothering you
with my questions?

548
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:32,926
I still want an answer.

549
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:34,695
Why are you going?

550
00:31:34,828 --> 00:31:36,964
-To meet someone.
-Who?

551
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,299
-[toilet flushing]
-[humming]

552
00:31:43,604 --> 00:31:44,705
[exhales deeply]

553
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:45,839
Good afternoon, sir.

554
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:47,708
[exhales deeply]

555
00:31:51,478 --> 00:31:53,013
-Excuse me.
-Sir.

556
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,916
My brother Bhawarlal's outside.

557
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:58,051
-Please send him in.
-Sure, sir! Sure, sir! Sure, sir!

558
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:01,088
-[breathing deeply]
-[door opens]

559
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:07,794
Shall I cancel the flight?

560
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:09,129
Not necessary.

561
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:11,498
It's just an anxiety attack. It's okay.

562
00:32:11,565 --> 00:32:12,966
Change your shirt.

563
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,035
Take your pill.

564
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:18,572
Bhawar...

565
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:24,978
Do the staff use the same restrooms
as the guests?

566
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:30,250
A steward just used one.

567
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:31,385
I'll have it cleaned.

568
00:32:32,386 --> 00:32:34,154
Shivdas Airport Services.

569
00:32:35,055 --> 00:32:36,390
Okay, I'll have him fired.

570
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:39,159
Paresh Goswami?

571
00:32:39,226 --> 00:32:40,727
Why do you want meet such a big shot?

572
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:42,529
To discuss a business partnership.

573
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:46,733
-He won't let you get anywhere near him.
-But I'll make him my business partner.

574
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:48,635
Are you kidding?

575
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:51,004
He won't even talk to you. Want to bet?

576
00:32:52,573 --> 00:32:55,576
-What if he did?
-Out of the question.

577
00:32:55,676 --> 00:32:58,145
We can just applaud
at his speech.

578
00:32:58,212 --> 00:33:00,080
[indistinct announcement over PA]

579
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:04,651
Why are you getting up?
That call's for business class.

580
00:33:04,718 --> 00:33:07,187
You didn't say what you'll do if you lose.

581
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:09,356
I'll tell you what to do when I win.

582
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,491
You're in business class?

583
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,960
You must be really rich.

584
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:16,330
Then why wait in the queue?
You're really strange!

585
00:33:16,463 --> 00:33:18,899
You spent 40,000
for business class?

586
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:20,968
Didn't you tell me I can't
meet him at function?

587
00:33:21,034 --> 00:33:22,703
So, business class.

588
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:25,005
You don't need 40,000,
20,000's enough.

589
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:27,374
I'll be returning by train, third class.

590
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:30,677
I'm not rich, ma'am.
Emptied my bank account to buy it.

591
00:33:31,378 --> 00:33:33,313
Anyways, please take care

592
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,082
of my fryums and pickles.

593
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:37,217
-Please take care.
-Sure.

594
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:47,928
-Good evening, sir. Welcome onboard.
-Ladies and gentlemen,

595
00:33:47,995 --> 00:33:49,429
this is your Captain Sharma
from flight deck...

596
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:51,431
-Hey guys, that's Paresh.
-Hello.

597
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:54,368
...we welcome you all
onboard Jaz Airlines,

598
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:56,603
JZ 433, Chennai to Mumbai.

599
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,572
We have with us today,
our chairman, Mr. Goswami...

600
00:33:58,639 --> 00:33:59,973
Hello, Mr. Paresh.

601
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,208
...our heartiest welcome to you, sir.

602
00:34:01,275 --> 00:34:03,410
We'll be flying
32,000 feet above sea level...

603
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:04,578
I'll see you in Bombay.

604
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:10,551
Congratulations on the award, sir.
Proud moment for the Jaz family.

605
00:34:20,761 --> 00:34:23,597
-Hello, sir. I'm Nedumaaran.
-Excuse me!

606
00:34:23,764 --> 00:34:25,399
You're the inspiration for my airline.

607
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:28,035
May I request you to return to your seat?

608
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,637
-Right, sir.
-It's fine.

609
00:34:30,704 --> 00:34:31,638
It's a pleasure, sir.

610
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:37,044
You intend to start an airline?

611
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:42,950
Sir... Yes, sir.

612
00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:46,253
An airline for the common man.
A low-cost airline for everyone.

613
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,721
-Nedurangan?
-It's Nedumaaran.

614
00:34:47,788 --> 00:34:48,722
Yes.

615
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:52,759
Would these people you speak of
want three square meals a day

616
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,062
or to fly in a plane?

617
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:57,431
They don't need to choose.

618
00:34:57,531 --> 00:34:59,366
With my ticket fare, they can do both.

619
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:01,235
-Sir...
-Are you planning

620
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:02,703
to do some kind of social service?

621
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,972
I want to execute this idea with you, sir.

622
00:35:07,074 --> 00:35:11,545
Everyone in here has an idea
to become a billionaire.

623
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:14,648
They all sound great.

624
00:35:15,015 --> 00:35:17,117
But practically impossible.

625
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:19,820
I never waste time
talking about the impossible.

626
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:21,488
My ideas are practically possible.

627
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:26,593
So, you want to sell tickets at low price
and still be profitable?

628
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:31,298
You think this didn't occur to us
all these years?

629
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,301
Yes, sir.

630
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:38,672
Today, no Indian can book air tickets
without a travel agency.

631
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:40,140
We all know that.

632
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:43,210
A big chunk of the fare
goes to the travel agent as commission.

633
00:35:43,277 --> 00:35:46,914
Like the middlemen in farming.
What if we bypass that?

634
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:49,616
Bypass a travel agency?

635
00:35:51,118 --> 00:35:53,687
Then how will customers book tickets?

636
00:35:53,754 --> 00:35:54,855
The internet!

637
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:57,524
They book tickets through computers.

638
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:59,126
Wow!

639
00:35:59,193 --> 00:36:02,963
So you're gonna make a farmer,
who has never owned a computer

640
00:36:03,096 --> 00:36:07,334
nor know internet,
book tickets and fly.

641
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:08,669
Fantastic!

642
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:12,706
Internet is available in 500 post offices
in Tamil Nadu alone.

643
00:36:12,773 --> 00:36:13,574
And there is internet

644
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,643
in 1,453 Reliance petrol bunks
all over India.

645
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,078
They can book the ticket there!

646
00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:20,614
Then the farmers
won't need computers nor internet, right?

647
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:25,485
But this requires
a specialized booking software.

648
00:36:25,752 --> 00:36:27,621
I don't think you're aware of it.

649
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:29,590
You must be aware of Interworld.

650
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:33,360
They make ticketing software
for all major airlines.

651
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:34,862
They've agreed to do it.

652
00:36:36,563 --> 00:36:40,367
You can make a tailor fly
alongside a textile baron.

653
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:48,942
-Yes, I can make that happen.
-Sir.

654
00:36:50,677 --> 00:36:51,945
But I won't.

655
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:55,082
Sir... Why not?

656
00:36:55,582 --> 00:37:00,687
Would anyone want to see beggars
and coolies on planes?

657
00:37:02,122 --> 00:37:04,424
I don't want my passengers to suffer.

658
00:37:04,525 --> 00:37:06,627
So that's why your air fare
is so expensive?

659
00:37:07,361 --> 00:37:09,196
I have an airline to run, my friend.

660
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:10,731
-But what you're doing is...
-Get him out!

661
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:12,199
Put him in economy.

662
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:15,869
Hello, sir?
Do you mind coming with me, sir?

663
00:37:15,936 --> 00:37:16,937
Why the fuck should I go?

664
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,872
-I paid for the ticket!
-Please cooperate...

665
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:21,275
Lay a hand on me,
I'll rip your throat out.

666
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:23,744
[whispering]

667
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:27,247
Ladies and gentlemen,

668
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:29,249
this is Captain Sharma again,
from the flight deck.

669
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:32,753
Due to technical difficulties,
this plane will return to Chennai.

670
00:37:32,819 --> 00:37:34,688
We apologize for the inconvenience.

671
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,460
You own the ticket.

672
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:43,463
I own the plane, my friend.

673
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:55,108
This way, sir.

674
00:37:55,175 --> 00:37:57,444
I know the drill. My job here is done.

675
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:58,879
Madam...

676
00:37:59,413 --> 00:38:01,315
your fryums and pickles.

677
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:02,783
-Thank you.
-See you.

678
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:04,551
-Nedumaaran...
-Yeah.

679
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:05,786
-Take care.
-Thanks.

680
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:06,720
Bye.

681
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:11,692
Mr. Nedumaaran.

682
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:14,328
I was on that flight, too.

683
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:16,597
I heard what you told Paresh.

684
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:20,167
I'm Prakash Babu. SCI Venture Capitalists.

685
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,302
I know. I've been
to your office many times.

686
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:23,403
Alright.

687
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,340
I'll give you the time
I didn't back then. Okay?

688
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:28,342
Five minutes. Come along.

689
00:38:29,009 --> 00:38:30,644
-[horn honking]
-[siren wailing]

690
00:38:32,112 --> 00:38:33,413
Take care of table two.

691
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:37,618
-Sir, coffee.
-Maaran...

692
00:38:37,684 --> 00:38:40,787
If you're hungry, we could've gone
to the five-star hotel nearby.

693
00:38:40,921 --> 00:38:43,023
This is the best place
to explain my idea.

694
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,725
-Are you well, bro?
-Yes, brother.

695
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:46,493
-What will you have?
-I ordered a dosa.

696
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,896
What's the connection between
an Udupi hotel and airlines?

697
00:38:49,696 --> 00:38:52,432
Today, an air ticket to Delhi
costs 12,000 rupees.

698
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:54,468
First class costs 20,000.

699
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:55,669
Definitely.

700
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:57,604
You need to spend a lot
to run an airline.

701
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:59,973
-Sir, dosa.
-Flight maintenance, hangar charges,

702
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,109
pilot salary, fuel costs, etc...

703
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:03,877
It's a costly business!

704
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:05,112
Dig in.

705
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,413
Please have it.

706
00:39:07,614 --> 00:39:09,917
Table number five hasn't received
their poori yet. Please check.

707
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:11,785
[indistinct chattering]

708
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:15,656
Table number five, 60 rupees.

709
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:19,893
How is it, sir?

710
00:39:20,494 --> 00:39:22,196
Actually, it's good.

711
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:23,897
-Very good.
-Thank you, sir!

712
00:39:23,964 --> 00:39:24,932
It's very good.

713
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:26,567
Brother!

714
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,370
-Where do you get your provisions?
-Chintamani stores at Moore market!

715
00:39:30,504 --> 00:39:32,739
Who is their biggest customer?

716
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:35,008
The five-star hotel next street.

717
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,911
You know what's funny?

718
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:40,747
Their chefs have our food for dinner.

719
00:39:40,981 --> 00:39:41,882
Please eat.

720
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:44,885
Bro?

721
00:39:44,985 --> 00:39:47,287
Have you had dosa
at the five-star hotel nearby?

722
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:50,591
When I get dosa here
for less than 20 bucks,

723
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,626
why will I waste 200 bucks there?

724
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:53,927
Sure, brother.

725
00:39:54,094 --> 00:39:57,931
-The dosa is great here. Enjoy!
-Yeah.

726
00:39:58,031 --> 00:39:59,266
See?

727
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:00,934
Everyone's happy.

728
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:05,005
The same dish is sold under a fancy name
at the five-star hotel.

729
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:07,374
The only difference is,
it's cheap out here.

730
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:09,610
But no difference in taste and hygiene.

731
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:11,078
No needless expenses.

732
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:13,180
My airline will operate the same way.

733
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,083
Why provide food and newspapers
for an hour-long flight?

734
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:18,519
I will neither provide these to them
nor charge for them.

735
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,220
10% of costs drop right away.

736
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:23,056
We keep our flights light.
No extra food or staff.

737
00:40:23,123 --> 00:40:25,692
Other airlines do two trips a day.
We will do six.

738
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:27,027
Six trips?

739
00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:28,195
How?

740
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:30,297
There is Flight Duty Time Limitation.

741
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:34,301
Staff cannot fly
for more than eight hours.

742
00:40:34,368 --> 00:40:36,136
We can have three shifts.

743
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:38,438
Three shifts. 18 hours of flying time.

744
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:40,440
Deduct C&D checks,
cleaning and fueling,

745
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:42,075
we can still fly for 14 hours.

746
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:44,344
Only humans tire. Planes don't, right?

747
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:48,115
But this isn't the norm.
It's not the convention.

748
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:50,784
Let's break every damn rule.

749
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:53,287
Look, sir.

750
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,923
No tables are empty,
none of the waiters are idle.

751
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:59,459
In simple words, our airline
is the Udupi Hotel in the sky.

752
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:03,597
You didn't tell me
you were starting an Udupi Hotel.

753
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:05,699
-Not on this street.
-Then, it's fine!

754
00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:07,234
-If I...
-...don't get on board

755
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:10,337
I've tried 23 VCs and 56 banks so far.

756
00:41:10,504 --> 00:41:14,174
And all they said is,
"Who is this crazy?"

757
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:18,345
If you say the same,
I'll just go find VC number 25.

758
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:25,752
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

759
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:29,289
Sir, bill.

760
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:36,063
-Maaran.
-Sir.

761
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:39,533
Come to my office next month. April 8th.

762
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,035
Convince the rest of the board too.

763
00:41:42,302 --> 00:41:43,770
Okay? Bye.

764
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:44,671
Yeah.

765
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:49,843
Apparently there's a girl named Annamayil.

766
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:53,046
My mom's blackmailing
to not talk unless I meet her.

767
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,748
I'm going to Madurai

768
00:41:55,415 --> 00:41:57,050
to straighten things out.

769
00:42:00,387 --> 00:42:03,223
The kids have gone nuts

770
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,325
after you showed them that film on planes.

771
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:09,563
We were doomed to carts, Esakki.
At least let the kids fly!

772
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:16,937
Maara!

773
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:35,122
THE CORPORATION OF MADURAI,
WELCOMES YOU

774
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:37,758
I told my brother not to borrow
from that loan shark Arivu!

775
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:39,993
He seized our land.
We now have drunks near home!

776
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,929
Hey! Get up!

777
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:43,130
Isn't this that girl's shop?

778
00:42:43,197 --> 00:42:45,999
Your mom told us to meet Annamayil.
Let's go!

779
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:47,935
-Let's buy sweets!
-Hello, son-in-law!

780
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:49,403
What brings you here?

781
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:51,271
Have a drink!

782
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:54,441
You rejected us
and now call him son-in-law?

783
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:56,743
Load up two kilos of cakes!

784
00:42:56,877 --> 00:43:00,781
Is this a scrap shop? It's a bakery!
It's "pack two kilos of cakes."

785
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:02,216
Whatever!

786
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:03,917
Give me samples of those two.

787
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:08,155
Eating for free is called sample, eh?
Nasty habit!

788
00:43:08,222 --> 00:43:11,758
How dare you come here
after calling me a bun?

789
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:14,294
Let's go, buddy.
This bakery sucks.

790
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:15,429
Are you married?

791
00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:18,098
Yes. Two kids. You?

792
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:20,834
We're meeting a prospective bride.
That's why we came to buy sweets.

793
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:23,704
So you've been at it for three years?

794
00:43:23,804 --> 00:43:25,739
What about the airplane company?

795
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:28,742
You know SCI? The Venture Capitalist?

796
00:43:28,876 --> 00:43:30,143
They've accepted my project.

797
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:33,280
Few formalities left with DGCA licenses,
and the NOC.

798
00:43:33,413 --> 00:43:35,816
So you're still on step one?

799
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,551
I'm already on step three!

800
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:39,520
Hello!

801
00:43:39,586 --> 00:43:41,421
I said I'll launch in a month!

802
00:43:41,555 --> 00:43:43,590
-Oh.
-Ah, now you're gobsmacked?

803
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:45,158
You wish!

804
00:43:45,325 --> 00:43:49,162
Had you bought an auto or bus,
you would've made some money!

805
00:43:49,363 --> 00:43:50,998
Is your husband doing
anything great?

806
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:54,468
We're set to open
another shop, mind you!?

807
00:43:54,568 --> 00:43:55,736
What does the little one want?

808
00:43:56,336 --> 00:43:58,805
-Want some cake?
-I packed these myself!

809
00:43:58,872 --> 00:44:01,041
Price is Rs.150, but for you it's Rs.100.

810
00:44:03,277 --> 00:44:05,512
Why is he so pissed?

811
00:44:06,246 --> 00:44:07,247
Shall we go?

812
00:44:07,347 --> 00:44:09,683
You call this cake?
It tastes like feet.

813
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:12,019
Sugary crap! Spit it out!

814
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:13,587
It's pretty good, buddy!

815
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:19,193
-This is crap!
-Damn country bumpkins!

816
00:44:19,259 --> 00:44:22,462
Would any sane person open a bakery
near a liquor shop?

817
00:44:22,596 --> 00:44:24,698
It should've been near
a school or college, right?

818
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:26,700
You need brains to work that out!

819
00:44:29,136 --> 00:44:31,538
Buddy! Maara!

820
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:33,640
She's still a spinster!

821
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:35,642
Nothing has happened yet.

822
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:37,211
What has not happened?

823
00:44:37,377 --> 00:44:40,280
That bun-girl isn't married yet!

824
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:43,050
Her loudmouth uncle told me!

825
00:44:46,386 --> 00:44:47,721
Can I eat her cakes now?

826
00:44:48,555 --> 00:44:51,892
Sweet news for the sweet-toothed!

827
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:54,328
Milk cakes! Cheese cakes! Butter cakes!

828
00:44:54,461 --> 00:44:56,930
-Buy one, get one free!
-Hi.

829
00:44:56,997 --> 00:44:58,732
Bommi Cakes!

830
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:00,033
It just melts in your mouth!

831
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,401
Those were your friend's kids, right?

832
00:45:01,468 --> 00:45:03,670
-Cheese cakes...
-Why did you bluff?

833
00:45:04,638 --> 00:45:05,873
Come on. Tell me!

834
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,375
-Hey, bun-face!
-Bommi...

835
00:45:09,243 --> 00:45:12,379
The world calls us crackpots.

836
00:45:12,513 --> 00:45:15,549
No one wants to marry either of us.
So why don't we get married?

837
00:45:16,984 --> 00:45:17,985
How about that?

838
00:45:18,085 --> 00:45:21,455
So why didn't you see this crackpot
in three years?

839
00:45:21,522 --> 00:45:23,891
Back then, I couldn't even feed myself.

840
00:45:23,991 --> 00:45:27,094
Those barren lands are green now!
Good income!

841
00:45:27,194 --> 00:45:30,330
My business kicks off in a month!
Good enough, right?

842
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:34,334
-Stuff just melts in your mouth!
-Hey.

843
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:35,636
Bommi Bakery!

844
00:45:36,336 --> 00:45:36,970
And if that fails too?

845
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:39,573
Who says it's only a husband
who provides for the wife?

846
00:45:39,706 --> 00:45:41,041
Won't you feed me?

847
00:45:41,475 --> 00:45:42,743
They are romancing! Romance!

848
00:45:44,811 --> 00:45:45,812
What do you say, bun-face?

849
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:49,116
-But I have three conditions.
-What are those?

850
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:52,019
Kiddo! We just got things up and running.
Why screw it up?

851
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:55,489
Number one, it's our money,
not yours or mine.

852
00:45:55,556 --> 00:45:57,124
-Understood?
-Yeah.

853
00:45:57,257 --> 00:46:01,061
Two, my business is not inferior
to your business in anyway.

854
00:46:01,128 --> 00:46:03,363
-Understood?
-Yeah.

855
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,866
2.1: because I know your brain
can't process more than two.

856
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:08,202
-Hey!
-Our family is very important to me.

857
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:11,405
And if you let us down,
I'll poison your food!

858
00:46:12,806 --> 00:46:14,808
If you're cool with all this,
we can marry tomorrow.

859
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:16,510
I already said yes to all of it!

860
00:46:17,044 --> 00:46:19,112
You better think hard

861
00:46:19,246 --> 00:46:20,581
because I won't divorce you.

862
00:46:20,647 --> 00:46:23,317
I won't ask for it either!
So how come you agreed?

863
00:46:23,784 --> 00:46:25,085
Sometimes, no matter
how hard you think

864
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:27,421
you end up doing what you want.

865
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:29,590
Why waste time?

866
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:32,025
Listen to me.

867
00:46:32,092 --> 00:46:33,827
Buy one loony and get another one.

868
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:35,829
Buy two loonies and get both free!

869
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:37,998
Both loonies are available! Come get them!

870
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:40,667
A thief from Sholavandhan
has robbed the bakery!

871
00:46:52,513 --> 00:46:54,081
Hey, rugged one!

872
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:58,318
Cuddle me just this once!

873
00:46:58,452 --> 00:47:00,087
A wild rabbit, I am!

874
00:47:00,187 --> 00:47:04,324
You are the one to snare me!

875
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:05,959
A thorny jungle, I am!

876
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:10,497
With your slick sickle
And your sly looks, you entice me!

877
00:47:10,631 --> 00:47:16,270
Hey stealthy cat! Like a ball of yarn,
You spin me around!

878
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:22,342
Like the coins in the folds of my saree,
You caress me!

879
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:24,211
As strong as a boulder, I am!

880
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:28,849
With a magic wand in your hand,
As a delicate thread, you weave me!

881
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:33,720
An elephant's hunger, I am, to you!

882
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:39,660
A corn kernel, you are, to me!

883
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:51,004
To all of you who came to this wedding

884
00:47:51,138 --> 00:47:53,240
jam cakes will be provided!
Savor and rejoice!

885
00:48:16,496 --> 00:48:17,931
Ward off the evil eye!

886
00:48:17,998 --> 00:48:19,666
Just thirty bucks?

887
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:21,101
-You deserve less.
-Oh, really?

888
00:48:23,604 --> 00:48:26,640
With love, you make me tremble!

889
00:48:26,707 --> 00:48:29,576
When I am on fire,
You stand there, humble!

890
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:35,282
You make me shiver with your gaze,
And you make my heart graze!

891
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:38,685
I can't be an adolescent forever,
To blush, I don't even remember!

892
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:41,388
Where did you find this power? Seize me!

893
00:48:41,455 --> 00:48:44,791
You tease me with a starter,
You make my mouth water

894
00:48:44,858 --> 00:48:47,394
To my joy, why don't you cater?
Embrace me!

895
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:50,464
Shall I punish you?

896
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:53,467
Or relish you?

897
00:48:53,634 --> 00:48:58,772
Little by little, I am gonna
Tease and finish you!

898
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:02,843
Bommi, for your new bakery, my dear.

899
00:49:07,314 --> 00:49:08,882
-Bommi?
-Yes, bro?

900
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,652
-Can I hang this here?
-Put it over there!

901
00:49:12,152 --> 00:49:14,788
When you see it, you'll be stunned!

902
00:49:14,855 --> 00:49:17,124
There's even a college next to it!

903
00:49:17,191 --> 00:49:19,259
Imagine my cakes being sold here
at Woodlands Drive-in.

904
00:49:23,931 --> 00:49:25,399
Do you know what this is? It's a pager.

905
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:26,900
Can you make calls?

906
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,435
-Who will you talk to?
-It's for you.

907
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:29,937
Thanks.

908
00:49:30,003 --> 00:49:32,639
-How does it look?
-That hand looks like a bag!

909
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:33,774
Why don't you draw?

910
00:49:35,609 --> 00:49:38,312
As the planes weight increases,
so will fuel cost.

911
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:39,847
An airline company in America...

912
00:49:39,947 --> 00:49:41,281
Pay attention!

913
00:49:41,415 --> 00:49:44,484
They cut down 500 pounds
by not painting their flights!

914
00:49:44,551 --> 00:49:46,687
That's four people flying for free!

915
00:49:46,753 --> 00:49:48,488
Don't you like things
that are heavy?

916
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:06,807
Without an axe, you split me apart!

917
00:50:06,874 --> 00:50:09,810
With spear-headed words,
You pierce my heart!

918
00:50:09,877 --> 00:50:12,846
As you touch me here and there

919
00:50:12,913 --> 00:50:15,682
Your heart's desire, I do hear!

920
00:50:15,782 --> 00:50:18,952
I'm burning hot! I need a love shot!

921
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:21,788
I'm no touch-me-not,
Delay not, lost in thought!

922
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:24,958
The mat is spread! The feast is set!

923
00:50:25,058 --> 00:50:27,327
Come to me, the word is said!

924
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:31,064
Why do you hesitate?
What are you waiting for?

925
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:33,867
Why this drama? Just take me now!

926
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:37,037
I've seen your ego! Why don't you let go?

927
00:50:37,171 --> 00:50:42,109
What's bubbling over, is my hidden desire!

928
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:48,282
Get ready, my love,
It's going to rain fire!

929
00:50:55,255 --> 00:50:58,825
To sum it up, passengers
must be able to buy plane tickets,

930
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:00,427
like they purchase soaps.

931
00:51:00,494 --> 00:51:02,229
Together, we can make it happen.

932
00:51:02,296 --> 00:51:03,630
That's it. Thank you.

933
00:51:04,164 --> 00:51:06,667
Indian Airlines
itself has a 1,000 crore debt.

934
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:09,403
And you want to make profits
with 1,000 rupee tickets to Delhi?

935
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:11,271
My competition is not with
Indian Airlines,

936
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:12,439
it's with Indian Railways.

937
00:51:12,506 --> 00:51:13,640
Indian Railways?

938
00:51:13,707 --> 00:51:15,509
And the Indian Railways
are doing very well.

939
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:18,979
A Boeing plane costs
136 crores, Mr. Maaran.

940
00:51:19,046 --> 00:51:21,114
Even a second-hand plane costs 90 crores.

941
00:51:21,181 --> 00:51:23,450
What can you do with just ten crores?

942
00:51:23,517 --> 00:51:25,118
I didn't say I was buying planes.

943
00:51:26,453 --> 00:51:27,654
We'll lease them.

944
00:51:28,222 --> 00:51:30,457
What if your revenue
is less than expected?

945
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:35,162
At 70% occupancy like most airlines,
we earn 12.42 crores.

946
00:51:35,229 --> 00:51:37,231
That's a profit of 4.14 crores.

947
00:51:37,297 --> 00:51:38,565
Sounds impossible.

948
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,467
-Deeksha?
-He's right.

949
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:42,336
Taking into consideration...

950
00:51:42,402 --> 00:51:44,238
If it's less than 70% occupancy?

951
00:51:44,538 --> 00:51:47,140
If it's 70% occupancy
at 10,000 rupees per ticket,

952
00:51:47,207 --> 00:51:50,944
won't I get at least 50% occupancy
with 1,000 rupee tickets?

953
00:51:51,011 --> 00:51:52,079
-Little difficult.
-[indistinct chattering]

954
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:54,214
You are talking way below market rates.

955
00:51:54,314 --> 00:51:57,651
Who will lease Boeing to you
at such low rates?

956
00:51:58,218 --> 00:51:59,453
-PlaneAm.
-Really?

957
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:04,992
The Twin Tower attack
affected their airline business.

958
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:07,694
They're willing to give us the planes
at half the price.

959
00:52:15,269 --> 00:52:16,336
Congratulations, Maaran.

960
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:17,971
They've sanctioned the funds.

961
00:52:18,038 --> 00:52:21,542
Now just get the DGCA license,
and you can launch your airline.

962
00:52:22,743 --> 00:52:24,178
Well done, Maaran.

963
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:25,379
All thanks to you, sir.

964
00:52:25,445 --> 00:52:26,947
-Oh, no...
-Thanks, sir.

965
00:52:27,014 --> 00:52:28,649
-Just one thing.
-Sir.

966
00:52:28,715 --> 00:52:32,686
Can you have the money ready
to reserve the planes right away?

967
00:52:33,153 --> 00:52:34,454
-You want me to arrange money?
-Yes.

968
00:52:34,588 --> 00:52:37,157
-How much would you need?
-47 lakhs.

969
00:52:37,224 --> 00:52:40,227
It will take us at least six months
to release funds.

970
00:52:40,627 --> 00:52:42,663
If PlaneAm hikes their rates
in the interim,

971
00:52:42,729 --> 00:52:45,432
or if someone else steals this idea,
we'll be in trouble.

972
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:47,734
Our entire business hinges on this.

973
00:52:47,801 --> 00:52:49,903
Unlicensed planes can't fly into India.

974
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:53,807
Get them to Malaysia
and start painting and stickering there.

975
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:56,476
So we can get them to India
once we get the license.

976
00:52:56,643 --> 00:52:58,278
-Good idea. I'll handle this.
-Good.

977
00:52:58,912 --> 00:53:00,447
MULLUM MALARUM

[sniffling]

979
00:53:15,128 --> 00:53:17,564
Folks come here to get loans
for tractors and autos.

980
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:19,900
You're the first to ask for airplanes!

981
00:53:19,967 --> 00:53:21,602
Alright then.

982
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:25,372
It's a proud moment
if one of ours starts an airline.

983
00:53:25,806 --> 00:53:28,242
I had a lot of dreams in my youth.

984
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:29,743
But no one lent me money.

985
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:31,879
Projected profit
for the first six months...

986
00:53:32,145 --> 00:53:34,381
That's okay. I'm allergic to computers.

987
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:38,852
-How much, ma'am? 47 lakhs?
-Yes, 47 lakhs.

988
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:41,588
Check if this loan is feasible.

989
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:45,425
Don't mistake me.
They need to do some work, right?

990
00:53:45,592 --> 00:53:47,561
Your house and farmlands
are good for 40 lakhs.

991
00:53:47,928 --> 00:53:49,363
They want an excess seven lakhs!

992
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:51,031
We can't give more...

993
00:53:51,098 --> 00:53:54,301
He's my teacher's son! Give him the money.

994
00:53:58,071 --> 00:54:00,207
Sign this, ma'am.

995
00:54:01,842 --> 00:54:04,111
You're starting a new business

996
00:54:04,211 --> 00:54:05,412
face east and sign.

997
00:54:06,914 --> 00:54:11,451
If you default payment by even a day,

998
00:54:11,518 --> 00:54:13,053
the next three months
you'll pay two-fold interest.

999
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,988
-I'll pay on time...
-That's okay.

1000
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:18,892
Ma'am, please leave.
I'll send the money over.

1001
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:21,562
-What's next?
-Get license from the DGCA.

1002
00:54:21,628 --> 00:54:23,764
-What's that?
-Like the RTO office in town?

1003
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:26,767
-We need a license from them to fly.
-We'll get it, right?

1004
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:28,168
Replay the reel from the beginning!

1005
00:54:31,738 --> 00:54:33,073
Okay, sir. I'll take care of this.

1006
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:38,178
-[bell dings]
-Why did you give him an appointment?

1007
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:41,481
He was referred by Prakash Babu from SCI.

1008
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:43,016
He's been coming here
for two months.

1009
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:45,819
He should know
meeting the DGCA isn't easy.

1010
00:54:45,886 --> 00:54:47,454
-Let him wait.
-Yes, sir.

1011
00:54:51,825 --> 00:54:53,927
Sir, you asked me to come at 8:30.

1012
00:54:53,994 --> 00:54:56,263
I was here at 7:00, before the peon.

1013
00:54:56,964 --> 00:54:57,898
I haven't been called yet.

1014
00:54:57,965 --> 00:54:59,633
-Please wait!
-Sir...

1015
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,569
-But I was the first appointment...
-Excuse me.

1016
00:55:03,737 --> 00:55:06,807
[In Hindi] All of you please leave
and come back after an hour.

1017
00:55:14,114 --> 00:55:15,315
Car is ready, sir.

1018
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:18,585
Sir, Maaran. Mr. Prakash Babu reference.

1019
00:55:18,685 --> 00:55:21,455
-I'm sorry. You're still here?
-It's alright.

1020
00:55:21,522 --> 00:55:23,957
I have an urgent meeting
with the new aviation minister.

1021
00:55:24,024 --> 00:55:25,993
-Can we meet tomorrow?
-Sure, sir.

1022
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,461
-Nice.
-Thanks.

1023
00:55:27,528 --> 00:55:28,195
Bye.

1024
00:55:34,268 --> 00:55:35,435
Morning, sir.

1025
00:55:47,781 --> 00:55:50,751
-Maaran, I went through your documents.
-Thanks.

1026
00:55:50,817 --> 00:55:51,952
-Very interesting.
-Sir.

1027
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,353
We can wrap it up tomorrow.

1028
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,222
Yeah? No problem, right?

1029
00:55:55,722 --> 00:55:57,691
-Sure, sir. I'll wait.
-Nice.

1030
00:55:58,492 --> 00:56:00,727
Have you set up a meeting
with the aviation minister?

1031
00:56:00,794 --> 00:56:01,962
I spoke to his assistant.

1032
00:56:02,062 --> 00:56:03,297
-When is it?
-Tomorrow.

1033
00:56:04,831 --> 00:56:05,766
[door opens]

1034
00:56:06,633 --> 00:56:07,768
Maaran!

1035
00:56:08,902 --> 00:56:09,770
Sir.

1036
00:56:10,804 --> 00:56:12,072
We can wrap it up today, right?

1037
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:14,508
He's off for a week.
Didn't you know?

1038
00:56:14,842 --> 00:56:16,243
Come back later.

1039
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,415
You're his assistant, right?

1040
00:56:22,115 --> 00:56:23,250
It's your job to keep him posted, right?

1041
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:27,154
You're a smart guy, right?
I can only say what he tells me to.

1042
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:31,258
How long will you make me wait?

1043
00:56:31,325 --> 00:56:32,759
Just for one meeting...

1044
00:56:33,861 --> 00:56:35,896
I don't have the time or money for this.

1045
00:56:36,697 --> 00:56:38,599
-Please understand.
-Then why do you keep coming?

1046
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,835
Maaran, do you know Ratan Tata?

1047
00:56:41,935 --> 00:56:45,672
He waited here for 20 years
to start Tata Airlines.

1048
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:47,674
He failed.
And you are a nobody, Mahesh.

1049
00:56:49,843 --> 00:56:51,211
Get going. Try to understand.

1050
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,182
Don't show up next week!

1051
00:57:00,454 --> 00:57:02,856
Either pay the interest
or give your house to Arivu.

1052
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:06,793
Please trust us.
We will pay back your money.

1053
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,531
Painting charges ate up all our money!
Just two lakhs left!

Damn! So much security!

-If we get caught, we're doomed!
-We won't.

1063
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:33,921
That stupid bet was a joke.

1064
00:57:33,987 --> 00:57:35,956
This isn't like meeting Paresh on a jet!

1065
00:57:36,023 --> 00:57:38,926
We can't just sneak in through the door!

1066
00:57:38,992 --> 00:57:40,928
I was taught

1067
00:57:40,994 --> 00:57:43,063
that if the door is ajar,
don't just get a foot in,

1068
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,431
dash in!

1069
00:57:44,498 --> 00:57:47,868
I can't lie
to the President, Maaran. Hello.

1070
00:57:47,935 --> 00:57:50,637
It's not wrong to lie for a good cause.

1071
00:57:50,704 --> 00:57:54,908
-"Falsehood takes on truth's nature..."
-What?

1072
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:57,244
Thiruvalluvar has said so.
The man inside knows it well.

1073
00:57:57,311 --> 00:57:59,813
It's not news if I don't meet him.

1074
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,848
-But...
-Sir, this way,

1075
00:58:00,914 --> 00:58:01,715
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

1076
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,084
But if I do meet him today,

1077
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:05,786
-you get an exclusive headline!
-Shh.

1078
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:09,623
Don't act over smart.

1079
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:13,927
I'm staking everything to do this

1080
00:58:13,994 --> 00:58:18,999
only because I'm just another sheep
among a billion here!

1081
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:21,568
And I hope you won't become one.

-You better deliver what you're promising.
-Excuse me, please follow me.

His words are etched here!

to be an eagle,

-If you didn't come in time,

Forgive me, Mom!
I'll never get angry again.

1274
01:08:15,162 --> 01:08:19,366
The next three years at the Air Force,
I had just one thought...

1275
01:08:23,136 --> 01:08:24,538
To make the common man fly.

1276

Why did you go to the President?

The new aviation minister,
Mr. Nakul Patel,

What do you think about this?

I came to check out turboprops for cargo.

You know a bumblebee, Balaiyya?

1312
01:10:25,692 --> 01:10:29,663
It's not designed aerodynamically.

1313
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:33,300
Yet, it flies all the time.

1314

Do you know why?

1315
01:10:34,701 --> 01:10:38,539
Because it doesn't know that it can't fly!

1316

Why? What happened?

1324

The Indian DGCA is asking them
for Boeing blueprints!

1325

Hundreds of Boeings fly in India!

No one has asked them for blueprints!

1327

PlaneAm told us
to check with our government.

1328
01:11:11,138 --> 01:11:14,575
PlaneAm's levied a 50 lakh fine
for blocking their flights.

01:18:47,094 --> 01:18:49,963
How much did Seenu uncle offer
to help you out?

1422
01:18:51,398 --> 01:18:54,101
Your mom was right
about you blabbing when you get hungry.

1423
01:18:54,168 --> 01:18:55,269
Hey!

1424
01:18:55,335 --> 01:18:58,572
Stop treating me like an idiot!
Your mom was at least direct.

1425
01:18:59,907 --> 01:19:01,775
Why are you fighting with me?

1426
01:19:02,209 --> 01:19:03,677
Let's figure out your next move.

1427
01:19:09,683 --> 01:19:11,451
Oh, yeah, I must figure that out.

1428
01:19:13,787 --> 01:19:17,090
I wonder why that didn't
occur to this dimwit!

1429
01:19:21,962 --> 01:19:25,933
Enlighten me
on how to run an airline, baker girl.

1430
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:27,034
Go ahead.

1431
01:19:27,901 --> 01:19:29,136
I'm all ears.

1432
01:19:30,804 --> 01:19:34,508
Every time you met investors
with your idea,

1433
01:19:34,842 --> 01:19:38,412
they laughed you out of the room.

1434
01:19:38,478 --> 01:19:41,048
To them, your idea
was just a damn cupcake.

1435
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:47,321
And what you demean
puts food on our table.

1436
01:19:48,755 --> 01:19:51,792
Despite my family's objections,
I married you!

1437
01:19:52,092 --> 01:19:54,962
I believed you'd make the poor fly!

1438
01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:57,464
Was it all just talk!

1439
01:19:57,764 --> 01:19:59,499
Weren't you serious at all!

1440
01:19:59,666 --> 01:20:01,168
Make it happen!

1441
01:20:02,302 --> 01:20:05,506
Never figured you for a loser, Maara!

1442
01:20:07,274 --> 01:20:09,042
Why do you want to live with a loser?

1443
01:20:10,344 --> 01:20:11,545
Get lost!

1444
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:13,080
Go away!

1445
01:20:14,181 --> 01:20:16,149
Achieve something and then get macho!

1446
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,451
Fucking ego!

1447
01:20:52,886 --> 01:20:56,890
My love!

1448
01:21:01,895 --> 01:21:06,366
My love!

1449
01:21:10,304 --> 01:21:14,575
Oh, love of my life!

1450
01:21:18,378 --> 01:21:19,046
Bommi.

1451
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:25,352
Like tiny fireflies,
You shone bright and faded away!

1452
01:21:26,286 --> 01:21:32,159
Like an elusive bird, you simply vanished!

1453
01:21:33,594 --> 01:21:36,697
I want you to spread roots

1454
01:21:36,763 --> 01:21:40,367
And render the shade of the neem!

1455
01:21:40,434 --> 01:21:46,273
In the comfort of your shadow,
I need to rest!

1456
01:21:47,341 --> 01:21:48,709
My heart has wilted...

1457
01:21:48,775 --> 01:21:51,778
-Hey, did Bommi come by?
-No.

1458
01:21:54,081 --> 01:21:58,185
Rush forth as a spring

1459
01:21:58,252 --> 01:22:01,088
And fill my life with life!

1460
01:22:47,167 --> 01:22:49,002
Four minutes!

1461
01:22:50,204 --> 01:22:54,942
The four minutes I couldn't see you

1462
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:59,580
When I couldn't see you

1463
01:22:59,646 --> 01:23:04,518
My entire being shriveled into a dot!

1464
01:23:05,185 --> 01:23:07,955
A dot, I became!

1465
01:23:12,292 --> 01:23:13,193
Where will I go, Maara?

1466
01:23:14,761 --> 01:23:15,762
This is my home.

1467
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:17,931
My only home.

1468
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:20,200
Oh, love of my life!

1469
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:27,808
I looked for you everywhere!

1470
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:29,910
I would have kept you running for days...

1471
01:23:30,878 --> 01:23:31,845
if I wasn't pregnant.

1472
01:23:37,217 --> 01:23:39,152
Who breaks such news like this?

1473
01:23:39,987 --> 01:23:42,055
Can't you talk like a normal person?

1474
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:44,858
I can't. This is who I am!

1475
01:23:45,726 --> 01:23:47,794
Only then it gets
into your thick skull, right?

1476
01:23:53,567 --> 01:23:56,003
-[birds chirping]
-[wings flapping]

1477
01:24:01,975 --> 01:24:02,976
Bommi.

1478
01:24:04,111 --> 01:24:06,146
[chirping and flapping continues]

1479
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,881
To hell with the net...

1480
01:25:06,874 --> 01:25:09,176
Damn those sparrows.
They never eat.

1481
01:25:09,243 --> 01:25:13,180
The bigger birds will eat it all
and leave them hungry.

1482
01:25:14,715 --> 01:25:18,118
A sparrow is neither too big
nor flies too high.

1483
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:22,222
So it needs very less food.

1484
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,001
What, Maara?

1485
01:25:52,753 --> 01:25:54,087
For its size,

1486
01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:56,957
and the height it flies,

1487
01:25:57,824 --> 01:25:59,359
it doesn't need much food.

1488
01:26:01,995 --> 01:26:02,996
So...

1489
01:26:04,498 --> 01:26:06,600
Not much fuel.

1490
01:26:06,667 --> 01:26:08,936
Small planes. A first in India.

1491
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:12,172
Bommi, small planes need less fuel.

1492
01:26:12,306 --> 01:26:14,341
So tickets can be even cheaper.

1493
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:16,276
First time in India,

1494
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:18,879
I'm going to convert cargo planes
to passenger ones.

1495
01:26:21,882 --> 01:26:23,884
We are leaders
when it comes to small planes.

1496
01:26:23,951 --> 01:26:25,853
Our turboprops are the best in the market.

1497
01:26:25,986 --> 01:26:28,555
But large planes
have replaced turboprops everywhere.

1498
01:26:28,655 --> 01:26:31,291
Your planes are used
only for cargo transport.

1499
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:34,027
I'll make your aircraft
passenger planes. Joint venture.

1500
01:26:34,094 --> 01:26:36,230
What is this "tur-bur" you speak of?

1501
01:26:36,296 --> 01:26:37,664
"Turboprops", uncle!

1502
01:26:37,731 --> 01:26:40,801
They're like the small Maruti 800 cars.

1503
01:26:40,868 --> 01:26:43,036
They only fly half as high as big planes.

1504
01:26:43,103 --> 01:26:45,305
But fuel costs also get halved.

1505
01:26:45,372 --> 01:26:47,474
Won't they be cramped?

1506
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:49,476
Yes, the planes are small.

1507
01:26:49,543 --> 01:26:52,312
But they will also get full
with just 70 people.

1508
01:26:52,379 --> 01:26:55,415
Large planes
need 200 passengers to get full.

1509
01:26:55,482 --> 01:26:59,486
Therefore, low costs and high profits!

1510
01:26:59,553 --> 01:27:02,389
You want us to give our planes
to you for free or what?

1511
01:27:02,489 --> 01:27:04,658
Every day 7,500 trains
operate in my country,

1512
01:27:04,758 --> 01:27:06,860
That's 2.5 crore passengers a day.

1513
01:27:06,927 --> 01:27:10,163
Plus, there are several private
and government bus services.

1514
01:27:10,230 --> 01:27:12,566
If just 2% of these people

1515
01:27:12,633 --> 01:27:14,701
fly in our airline,

1516
01:27:14,768 --> 01:27:16,370
we can make crores in revenues.

1517
01:27:16,436 --> 01:27:18,372
Can't fly too far with turboprops, sir.

1518
01:27:18,438 --> 01:27:21,275
We can't do prestige routes
like Chennai to Delhi.

1519
01:27:21,341 --> 01:27:22,442
Should it be a non-stop to Delhi?

1520
01:27:22,976 --> 01:27:26,280
We'll have stops at Vijayawada
and Nagpur and voila!

1521
01:27:26,346 --> 01:27:30,017
We cover big cities and small towns!
That's the strength of a sparrow!

1522
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:33,820
If we share costs with Turboprop company,
in a joint venture...

1523
01:27:33,987 --> 01:27:35,255
-four crores will suffice!
-Super, sir.

1524
01:27:35,322 --> 01:27:37,958
Tea bill, 800 bucks, is still due!

1525
01:27:38,025 --> 01:27:41,528
It's about to rain millions
and you're asking for 800 bucks!

1526
01:27:41,595 --> 01:27:43,330
-Get lost!
-Yeah, right!

1527
01:27:43,497 --> 01:27:45,899
You can't even pay 800,
but building castles in air.

1528
01:27:49,503 --> 01:27:51,104
-I'll take these with me.
-Very well.

1529
01:27:54,107 --> 01:27:56,677
I listened to you and set up shop here,

1530
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:58,812
I was worried it wouldn't take off.

1531
01:27:58,946 --> 01:28:02,349
I expected 300-400 bucks tops,
but I make over a 1,000.

1532
01:28:02,482 --> 01:28:04,151
A thousand?

1533
01:28:04,284 --> 01:28:05,419
Per week?

1534
01:28:05,519 --> 01:28:07,321
No! Per day!

1535
01:28:07,454 --> 01:28:10,958
The college girls across the road
come by every day,

1536
01:28:11,091 --> 01:28:14,862
and the boys follow them
in like puppy dogs!

1537
01:28:15,028 --> 01:28:17,030
My shop is in the right place!

1538
01:28:17,831 --> 01:28:19,333
Whose idea was that?

1539
01:28:19,466 --> 01:28:20,534
Shall we go?

1540
01:28:21,368 --> 01:28:22,769
Not bad, Maara.

1541
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:26,039
I thought you were the only one
who followed girls to bakeries!

1542
01:28:26,206 --> 01:28:28,041
But most boys are, too.

1543
01:28:28,809 --> 01:28:30,043
Isn't it time for work?

1544
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:33,046
Let's eat. I've ordered fritters.
I'm really hungry.

1545
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:34,982
A coffee, bro.
Lots of sugar.

1546
01:28:35,048 --> 01:28:35,949
Okay, madam.

1547
01:28:39,453 --> 01:28:40,687
-No, thanks.
-What's wrong?

1548
01:28:43,123 --> 01:28:44,625
Paresh isn't in India this month.

1549
01:28:44,725 --> 01:28:47,227
We must get in our planes secretively
before he returns.

1550
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:48,662
How?

1551
01:28:48,795 --> 01:28:50,731
Ground work and feasibility reports
are done.

1552
01:28:50,864 --> 01:28:53,000
I even had a meeting
with a French company.

1553
01:28:54,001 --> 01:28:57,004
If we get this done,
we'll be up and running!

1554
01:28:57,070 --> 01:28:59,573
We don't even need eight crores,
just four crores will do.

1555
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:01,975
So why wait? Start!

1556
01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:04,811
We can!

1557
01:29:06,046 --> 01:29:08,916
But only after the company is registered,
we can take off.

1558
01:29:14,922 --> 01:29:15,956
Bommi...

1559
01:29:16,456 --> 01:29:18,025
Can you lend me 15,000?

1560
01:29:19,993 --> 01:29:21,828
Because... I...

1561
01:29:28,535 --> 01:29:31,505
-Is that my coffee? Lots of sugar?
-Indeed.

1562
01:29:31,638 --> 01:29:33,440
-For registration...
-Give me the bill.

1563
01:29:34,441 --> 01:29:37,544
Just pay the registration fee.
I can finalize the deal.

1564
01:29:38,712 --> 01:29:40,214
I'll succeed this time.

1565
01:29:42,049 --> 01:29:43,550
I'll repay you in three months.

1566
01:29:44,618 --> 01:29:46,787
I'll keep accounts.
You keep track of it, too.

1567
01:29:55,629 --> 01:29:56,496
No, I...

1568
01:30:07,808 --> 01:30:08,809
Good day, sir.

1569
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:13,847
Maara...

1570
01:30:14,348 --> 01:30:16,683
not just fifteen,
I'll give you twenty thousand

1571
01:30:17,150 --> 01:30:19,453
You always talk
of doing great things

1572
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,088
so act accordingly.

1573
01:30:22,222 --> 01:30:24,091
Why this false pride with me?

1574
01:30:31,999 --> 01:30:32,866
Sorry.

1575
01:30:35,435 --> 01:30:39,773
Why is it so hard for you
to ask your wife for help?

1576
01:30:39,873 --> 01:30:40,908
I've said this already!

1577
01:30:40,974 --> 01:30:43,610
My bakery is yours
and your airline is mine.

1578
01:30:43,677 --> 01:30:44,778
Isn't that our deal?

1579
01:31:31,758 --> 01:31:33,827
One fresh juice for the boss lady!

1580
01:31:48,575 --> 01:31:49,676
Bhawar?

1581
01:31:55,482 --> 01:31:56,483
Hey!

1582
01:31:57,551 --> 01:31:58,819
-Yes, sir!
-How?

1583
01:32:00,254 --> 01:32:03,290
You're a goddamn pauper.

1584
01:32:03,423 --> 01:32:05,192
How can you sleep so peacefully?

1585
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:08,929
Brother, come.

1586
01:32:08,996 --> 01:32:11,632
Something is not right.

1587
01:32:11,698 --> 01:32:12,766
Is there a problem?

1588
01:32:12,833 --> 01:32:14,968
Relax, Paresh.
All is well.

1589
01:32:15,035 --> 01:32:18,805
Just a small glitch with turboprops.
We'll sort it tomorrow. Okay?

1590
01:32:18,872 --> 01:32:20,541
How many times have I told you?

1591
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:23,911
Good news can wait,

1592
01:32:23,977 --> 01:32:25,812
but tell me the bad news right away!

1593
01:32:25,879 --> 01:32:27,881
The planes that we wanted for cargo

1594
01:32:27,948 --> 01:32:30,717
have been blocked
as passenger planes by someone.

1595
01:32:30,784 --> 01:32:32,319
Ask Mirza to talk.

1596
01:32:32,386 --> 01:32:34,321
And if they do not agree, make them agree!

1597
01:32:34,388 --> 01:32:37,724
Isn't passenger transport
a better offer for them?

1598
01:32:37,791 --> 01:32:39,760
Pay them more than what we promised!

1599
01:32:39,826 --> 01:32:42,496
They're not interested!

1600
01:32:42,563 --> 01:32:43,664
Call Ananth!

1601
01:32:43,964 --> 01:32:45,199
It's 3:00 a.m., Paresh!

1602
01:32:45,265 --> 01:32:47,701
[in Gujarati] So? I'm awake!
Why should he sleep?

1603
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:53,941
What is this?

1604
01:32:56,376 --> 01:32:57,244
Damn!

1605
01:32:57,311 --> 01:33:00,280
It's a joint venture.
Between Turboprop International

1606
01:33:00,347 --> 01:33:02,316
and NCS Aviation Private Limited.

1607
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:06,720
Registered in the name of Ms. Sundari.

1608
01:33:06,787 --> 01:33:08,789
With Turboprop in the forefront,

1609
01:33:08,856 --> 01:33:11,625
he stayed hidden and sealed the deal!

1610
01:33:11,692 --> 01:33:14,494
I signed off without a second thought

1611
01:33:14,561 --> 01:33:16,630
as only you've been dealing
with Turboprops.

1612
01:33:16,697 --> 01:33:17,865
I'm sorry.

1613
01:33:21,635 --> 01:33:22,769
Don't worry, Paresh.

1614
01:33:22,836 --> 01:33:24,938
He's not rich like Balaiyya.

1615
01:33:25,005 --> 01:33:26,139
He's just a fool!

1616
01:33:26,206 --> 01:33:28,442
He'll run away
with his tail between his legs!

1617
01:33:28,942 --> 01:33:30,244
Balaiyya is the fool.

1618
01:33:31,245 --> 01:33:33,614
Once his father's wealth is gone,
he'll disappear!

1619
01:33:35,315 --> 01:33:37,951
Bhawar, you call up whoever, wherever,

1620
01:33:38,018 --> 01:33:38,819
but finish him.

1621
01:33:39,286 --> 01:33:40,387
Don't be hasty, Paresh.

1622
01:33:40,454 --> 01:33:43,457
The CBI is still investigating
what we did last time.

1623
01:33:43,524 --> 01:33:44,525
I don't care.

1624
01:33:44,591 --> 01:33:48,562
His plane
must not land here, Ananth. Okay?

1625
01:33:49,663 --> 01:33:50,397
Okay.

1626
01:33:50,964 --> 01:33:52,232
Damn villager.

1627
01:33:52,299 --> 01:33:54,201
Yes. That's what he is!

1628
01:33:54,268 --> 01:33:56,537
Not him, me.

1629
01:33:57,237 --> 01:34:01,341
India must only speak
of my story from rags to riches.

1630
01:34:02,042 --> 01:34:05,379
There should be
only one Paresh in India. Right?

1631
01:34:05,445 --> 01:34:08,348
No one knows you here, buddy!

1632
01:34:08,415 --> 01:34:10,951
But everyone seems to know the witch!

1633
01:34:11,018 --> 01:34:12,419
-How are you?
-I'm good!

1634
01:34:12,486 --> 01:34:13,587
How are you, brother?

1635
01:34:14,521 --> 01:34:16,156
-I was just praising you!
-Yeah, I heard.

1636
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:17,991
-Take care of the bakery, uncle!
-Sure.

1637
01:34:18,058 --> 01:34:20,761
Make fun of me all you want,
I'll still cook a feast for you!

1638
01:34:20,827 --> 01:34:22,229
-Come and eat.
-Sure!

1639
01:34:22,296 --> 01:34:24,064
My sister is getting married.

1640
01:34:24,131 --> 01:34:25,032
Just a minute, son-in-law!

1641
01:34:25,699 --> 01:34:26,800
Come here.

1642
01:34:27,267 --> 01:34:28,068
Leave.

1643
01:34:29,570 --> 01:34:30,838
Money is the problem, right?

1644
01:34:30,904 --> 01:34:32,239
Yes. Why?

1645
01:34:32,306 --> 01:34:35,342
Don't worry. That's no problem at all.

1646
01:34:35,409 --> 01:34:36,176
Who much?

1647
01:34:37,578 --> 01:34:39,413
I meant "how much" in English?

1648
01:34:40,714 --> 01:34:42,850
I... I can handle it.

1649
01:34:42,916 --> 01:34:44,852
Why do you hesitate to ask me?

1650
01:34:44,918 --> 01:34:45,752
Just a minute.

1651
01:34:49,089 --> 01:34:51,391
Here you go. It's money too.

1652
01:34:51,758 --> 01:34:53,026
What's the matter?

1653
01:34:57,030 --> 01:35:00,901
There is 11,528 rupees!

1654
01:35:01,735 --> 01:35:04,905
My life savings.

1655
01:35:04,972 --> 01:35:07,674
Take it all and get things going!

1656
01:35:07,741 --> 01:35:08,775
Happy?

1657
01:35:09,243 --> 01:35:12,713
Don't tell Bommi about this,
she'll rip me apart!

1658
01:35:12,779 --> 01:35:14,848
-Uncle Alapparai.
-Quit laughing!

1659
01:35:14,915 --> 01:35:17,117
It's for all of you. Split it up equally!

1660
01:35:17,184 --> 01:35:20,888
We need 3.25 crores.

1661
01:35:20,954 --> 01:35:25,692
About 2,000 times what you've given us.

1662
01:35:27,461 --> 01:35:28,729
Three crores?

1663
01:35:29,563 --> 01:35:32,699
I don't even know how many zeroes it has.

1664
01:35:34,568 --> 01:35:36,236
This is all I have.

1665
01:35:37,304 --> 01:35:38,572
Please don't mistake me.

1666
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:41,975
Won't this be enough?

1667
01:35:42,109 --> 01:35:43,110
It's not that, uncle?

1668
01:35:43,744 --> 01:35:44,811
Uncle!

1669
01:35:45,712 --> 01:35:48,549
Your heart is much bigger
than a mere three crores!

1670
01:35:56,256 --> 01:35:57,424
I don't have much...

1671
01:35:58,625 --> 01:35:59,626
Keep it safe.

1672
01:36:09,002 --> 01:36:10,370
-Please come.
-Sir.

1673
01:36:10,437 --> 01:36:15,509
As a bank manager, I should've called
the Income Tax Department first.

1674
01:36:15,576 --> 01:36:17,144
Sir... How much, sir?

1675
01:36:18,178 --> 01:36:19,613
See for yourself.

1676
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:23,116
One and a half lakhs. Twenty thousand.
One lakh. Ten thousand. Five hundred.

1677
01:36:23,183 --> 01:36:26,753
Your account has been receiving
deposits all day from Sholavandhan!

1678
01:36:29,323 --> 01:36:31,692
-Can I... make a call?
-Yeah.

1679
01:36:31,758 --> 01:36:32,693
Sure.

1680
01:36:38,866 --> 01:36:39,867
Sholavandhan Post?

1681
01:36:39,933 --> 01:36:41,101
-Maara's on the line!
-[all clamoring]

1682
01:36:41,201 --> 01:36:45,072
Maara, I sent two lakhs to your account.
Did you get it?

1683
01:36:45,138 --> 01:36:46,440
Munuswamy brother...

1684
01:36:48,108 --> 01:36:49,443
How did you raise so much?

1685
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:53,013
-I pledged my land with Arivu.
-Give me the phone.

1686
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,716
I pushed my sister's wedding for a bit!

1687
01:36:55,782 --> 01:36:59,119
The groom will wait until you repay!

1688
01:36:59,186 --> 01:37:00,888
-You keep going!
-You...

1689
01:37:01,788 --> 01:37:05,292
You should've told me!
Why did you go to that bloodsucking Arivu?

1690
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:10,531
We can't be bystanders and see you
work hard to make our lives better.

1691
01:37:11,598 --> 01:37:16,703
It's because you stopped the train,
our land prices have skyrocketed!

1692
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:18,338
-Let me speak to Maaran!
-Go on!

1693
01:37:18,405 --> 01:37:22,409
I sold all my paddy and sent 8,000 rupees.
Did you get it?

1694
01:37:22,476 --> 01:37:23,677
I did.

1695
01:37:23,744 --> 01:37:25,379
-Yes, he got it!
-Give it to him!

1696
01:37:25,445 --> 01:37:26,780
-Here you go!
-Calm down!

1697
01:37:26,847 --> 01:37:28,315
Maara, my boy...

1698
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:30,617
Grandpa...

1699
01:37:30,684 --> 01:37:33,287
I just plant chilies
as there were no rains.

1700
01:37:33,353 --> 01:37:35,355
I could only send 500 rupees.
Did you get it?

1701
01:37:36,156 --> 01:37:38,158
You're struggling without rain...

1702
01:37:39,693 --> 01:37:40,861
Why did you do it?

1703
01:37:40,994 --> 01:37:42,996
This kid wants to talk to you!

1704
01:37:43,063 --> 01:37:45,999
Talk to him! Here you go! Talk!

1705
01:37:46,099 --> 01:37:47,668
-Hello?-Selvi?

1706
01:37:47,734 --> 01:37:49,469
Uncle Maara,

1707
01:37:49,536 --> 01:37:51,405
did you get my money?

1708
01:37:51,939 --> 01:37:53,240
How did you get so much money?

1709
01:37:53,307 --> 01:37:55,209
From my piggy bank.

1710
01:37:55,275 --> 01:37:57,711
Take me in your airplane, too.

1711
01:37:58,946 --> 01:38:00,914
Make your donations right away!

1712
01:38:00,981 --> 01:38:03,617
Stand in line. Don't cut in.

1713
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:06,320
All of you who chipped in,
please eat and go.

1714
01:38:06,386 --> 01:38:10,257
Thirty seven thousand. Twelve thousand.
Forty thousand. Thirty one thousand.

1715
01:38:10,324 --> 01:38:12,292
Look properly! It's 31 lakhs.

1716
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:14,428
Lakhs?

1717
01:38:14,528 --> 01:38:19,032
Get the airplanes here real soon, Maara!

1718
01:38:19,132 --> 01:38:22,803
I will fly all our people
to my daughter's wedding!

1719
01:38:22,936 --> 01:38:25,439
No, sir. Let's first get back
your lands from Arivu.

1720
01:38:25,506 --> 01:38:27,007
I'll come talk to him myself.

1721
01:38:27,074 --> 01:38:28,175
Maara...

1722
01:38:28,242 --> 01:38:29,109
Mom?

1723
01:38:29,176 --> 01:38:31,144
If you're the teacher's son,
I'm his wife.

1724
01:38:31,211 --> 01:38:34,581
I demanded the documents back from Arivu.

1725
01:38:34,648 --> 01:38:36,817
He told us to pay up
six months interest anyway.

1726
01:38:36,884 --> 01:38:39,019
No one can touch us if we're united!

1727
01:38:39,086 --> 01:38:41,922
Victory or defeat,
it's all in your hands now!

1728
01:38:42,756 --> 01:38:43,991
You'll win, right?

1729
01:38:44,825 --> 01:38:46,727
Your father is always with you.

1730
01:38:47,794 --> 01:38:49,963
We're all praying for you, son!

1731
01:38:50,063 --> 01:38:51,164
Win.

1732
01:38:51,298 --> 01:38:53,000
We're counting on you. Win!

1733
01:38:53,133 --> 01:38:55,102
Don't cry! He'll win!

1734
01:38:55,235 --> 01:38:56,937
Victory is yours.

1735
01:38:57,004 --> 01:38:58,639
-Shall I hang up?
-Okay, Mom.

1736
01:39:01,942 --> 01:39:04,511
All major airports
are under Paresh's control.

1737
01:39:04,578 --> 01:39:06,346
You'll land your planes
in these airstrips?

1738
01:39:06,413 --> 01:39:08,949
Indeed. Built in the British era.

1739
01:39:09,016 --> 01:39:12,019
Airstrips used for postal delivery
and diplomatic trips.

1740
01:39:12,085 --> 01:39:13,854
Nehru and Kamaraj have been here.

1741
01:39:13,921 --> 01:39:15,722
Abandoned unused airstrips?

1742
01:39:15,789 --> 01:39:17,391
How many are there? Two or three?

1743
01:39:17,457 --> 01:39:18,225
Five hundred!

1744
01:39:18,859 --> 01:39:20,527
Five hundred of these exist across India.

1745
01:39:20,594 --> 01:39:22,362
We'll prep them for our planes to land!

1746
01:39:22,429 --> 01:39:26,934
The sky belongs to us all!

1747
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,171
Let us bide our time to get hold of it!

1748
01:39:31,505 --> 01:39:36,043
Let's dispense with the phonies
And kick out the shams!

1749
01:39:36,109 --> 01:39:40,848
Let's build some iron wings
And take to the stars!

1750
01:39:40,914 --> 01:39:45,519
Those who call this a fool's errand
Just admitted to being fools!

1751
01:39:45,586 --> 01:39:50,023
They show up first in line to kiss up
When victory is at hand!

1752
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:54,494
Those who call this a fool's errand
Just admitted to being fools!

1753
01:39:54,561 --> 01:39:59,199
They show up first in line to kiss up
When victory is at hand!

1754
01:39:59,266 --> 01:40:03,737
The sky is very near!
Let us jump up without fear!

1755
01:40:03,804 --> 01:40:08,375
It isn't too far off!
As we get closer, the dream grows nearer!

1756
01:40:10,878 --> 01:40:12,513
What are you saying? Be clear.

1757
01:40:12,579 --> 01:40:15,549
For the first time, Indians can book
air tickets with credit cards.

1758
01:40:15,616 --> 01:40:17,918
How many Indians have credit cards?

1759
01:40:17,985 --> 01:40:20,187
They all have telephones, right?

1760
01:40:20,921 --> 01:40:23,590
They can call our call center
and book tickets.

1761
01:40:23,657 --> 01:40:25,325
With a PNR number

1762
01:40:25,392 --> 01:40:27,461
they can pick up tickets
at their bank or supermarket.

1763
01:40:29,897 --> 01:40:30,898
But...

1764
01:40:31,565 --> 01:40:34,401
We are trying this
with publicly owned computers.

1765
01:40:34,535 --> 01:40:38,238
Interworld spends six months
just testing this software!

1766
01:40:38,372 --> 01:40:40,474
We don't have that kind of luxury.

1767
01:40:40,541 --> 01:40:42,376
No one else has tried this here before.

1768
01:40:42,442 --> 01:40:43,911
So this is a first in India.

1769
01:40:46,813 --> 01:40:49,283
You want to sell your tickets
at the railway counter?

1770
01:40:49,349 --> 01:40:52,519
Why will I agree
to you taking away my business.

1771
01:40:52,586 --> 01:40:56,256
You find 10000 people in waiting list
for AC coaches every day.

1772
01:40:56,323 --> 01:40:58,025
I'll take only those people in my airline.

1773
01:40:58,458 --> 01:41:01,795
Just give me a small space
next to your reservation counter.

1774
01:41:01,862 --> 01:41:03,197
Bottom line is,
they need to travel, right?

1775
01:41:04,031 --> 01:41:05,532
Alright. It's a great idea!

1776
01:41:06,533 --> 01:41:07,601
All the very best, Mr. Maaran.

1777
01:41:21,915 --> 01:41:26,320
You're never too old
To stop chasing the moon, my friend!

1778
01:41:26,486 --> 01:41:30,824
Chase your dreams
And there are no worries, dear comrade!

1779
01:41:30,891 --> 01:41:35,529
Even if you lose, the world will not mind!

1780
01:41:35,596 --> 01:41:40,067
Stand by and do nothing?
It will never respect you!

1781
01:41:40,133 --> 01:41:44,938
If the battle rages on
With even no small victories

1782
01:41:45,005 --> 01:41:49,510
Won't it change one day
To a celebration sans failures?

1783
01:41:49,710 --> 01:41:50,377
BISMI MOBILES
SALES & SERVICES

1784
01:41:50,677 --> 01:41:54,081
No one else can live your life...

1785
01:41:54,147 --> 01:41:55,883
-Call for you!
-What is it called?

1786
01:41:55,949 --> 01:41:58,318
The company is called Deccan Air.
Do you like it?

1787
01:41:59,019 --> 01:42:00,020
He is medically unfit.

1788
01:42:00,087 --> 01:42:01,088
-Unfit?
-Yes.

1789
01:42:01,154 --> 01:42:02,923
You bugger off. You come in!

1790
01:42:02,990 --> 01:42:07,027
It isn't too far off!
As we get closer, the dream grows nearer!

1791
01:42:07,094 --> 01:42:08,929
Deccan Air won't get pilots.

1792
01:42:08,996 --> 01:42:11,198
We paid them three times more
than Maaran did.

1793
01:42:11,265 --> 01:42:12,132
They took it!

1794
01:42:12,633 --> 01:42:15,736
Dismiss all of them next month.

1795
01:42:15,802 --> 01:42:16,703
Brother?

1796
01:42:16,803 --> 01:42:17,738
If I can buy them...

1797
01:42:18,172 --> 01:42:19,206
anybody can buy them.

1798
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:21,708
Maara is here!

1799
01:42:21,775 --> 01:42:23,844
The pilots didn't show up!

1800
01:42:23,911 --> 01:42:25,345
-Seby!
-Where is he off to?

1801
01:42:25,412 --> 01:42:26,847
-Do you get anything he does?
-Maara, come soon!

1802
01:42:26,914 --> 01:42:29,449
Where are you going?
None of our pilots came!

1803
01:42:38,225 --> 01:42:40,961
A guy who can buy a government
can buy anyone.

1804
01:42:41,061 --> 01:42:41,929
There are our pilots.

1805
01:42:41,995 --> 01:42:44,364
Retired military aviators
who flew fighter jets for India.

1806
01:42:44,431 --> 01:42:46,667
There is an age limit! How will this work?

1807
01:42:51,972 --> 01:42:53,307
Let me in on the joke!

1808
01:42:53,373 --> 01:42:55,409
Air Force pilots retire at 57,

1809
01:42:55,475 --> 01:42:56,810
civilian pilots retire at 61.

1810
01:42:56,877 --> 01:42:58,512
They can fly for another four years!

1811
01:42:58,579 --> 01:43:00,714
Kickass! Two can play this game.

1812
01:43:00,814 --> 01:43:02,382
We aren't Madurai folk for nothing.

1813
01:43:02,482 --> 01:43:04,751
Captain Rajiv Manohar,
he coordinated all this.

1814
01:43:04,852 --> 01:43:06,253
Retired as Air Commodore.

1815
01:43:23,971 --> 01:43:26,240
I don't believe this.
Is this how it is done!

1816
01:43:26,306 --> 01:43:28,342
-We need to focus on the airline, uncle!
-Yes, yes!

1817
01:43:41,522 --> 01:43:43,624
What brings you to the office, boss?

1818
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:44,992
A proposal.

1819
01:43:45,726 --> 01:43:46,727
What proposal?

1820
01:43:46,793 --> 01:43:48,295
A business proposal!

1821
01:43:48,362 --> 01:43:49,463
What business?

1822
01:43:51,064 --> 01:43:53,066
Do you embrace all your
vendors like this?

1823
01:43:55,969 --> 01:44:00,807
Let my catering division
take care of your in-flight snacks.

1824
01:44:01,775 --> 01:44:04,111
Logistically impossible
with just one outlet in Madras.

1825
01:44:04,178 --> 01:44:05,445
It is possible!

1826
01:44:05,512 --> 01:44:07,614
Who told you Madras was my only base?

1827
01:44:07,681 --> 01:44:08,982
I have franchises!

1828
01:44:10,484 --> 01:44:13,053
Che's family in Vijayawada.
My brother is in Madurai.

1829
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:15,489
Projected monthly turnovers ten lakhs!

1830
01:44:15,556 --> 01:44:18,158
That's 1.2 crores per year!

1831
01:44:20,994 --> 01:44:23,964
Welcome to Deccan Air, Sundari Nedumaaran!

1832
01:44:24,031 --> 01:44:27,067
Don't expect
any special treatment. Alright?

1833
01:44:27,134 --> 01:44:30,304
You too, don't expect any discounts. Deal.

1834
01:44:33,407 --> 01:44:34,942
We're talking business!

1835
01:44:35,008 --> 01:44:36,109
Business is done, right?

1836
01:44:38,078 --> 01:44:39,746
It's coming!

1837
01:44:39,847 --> 01:44:40,948
What's he up to?

1838
01:44:41,081 --> 01:44:42,816
What's this? I don't understand!

1839
01:44:42,883 --> 01:44:44,351
Like we get everything you say.

1840
01:44:44,418 --> 01:44:46,520
When our planes land for the first time

1841
01:44:46,653 --> 01:44:49,356
it would be auspicious
to land facing east.

1842
01:44:49,489 --> 01:44:51,992
You won't get it! Back off!

1843
01:44:52,059 --> 01:44:55,829
No! They'll land only as per
the designated coordinates!

1844
01:44:55,963 --> 01:44:57,464
There you go again!

1845
01:44:57,531 --> 01:44:59,333
Never clear.

1846
01:44:59,867 --> 01:45:01,101
That's ours, right?

1847
01:45:01,168 --> 01:45:03,704
Look, uncle! Our plane is coming!

1848
01:45:04,137 --> 01:45:05,939
Chennai Tower, this is Deccan Air 582.

1849
01:45:06,006 --> 01:45:07,941
Minimum fuel.
Requesting landing clearance.

1850
01:45:08,008 --> 01:45:10,143
Go around, Deccan Air 582.

1851
01:45:10,477 --> 01:45:12,980
Where are the other two planes?

1852
01:45:13,046 --> 01:45:15,649
Hence the three garlands?
They'll come in two days.

1853
01:45:18,218 --> 01:45:19,720
Why aren't they landing?

1854
01:45:19,786 --> 01:45:21,188
They are not getting permission to land?

1855
01:45:21,255 --> 01:45:23,390
Is there a problem with DA 582 landing?

1856
01:45:23,457 --> 01:45:25,926
It's huge! Garlands are small, damn!

1857
01:45:25,993 --> 01:45:27,427
-Maara...
-How long will they circle around?

1858
01:45:27,494 --> 01:45:29,229
Get to the ATC, boys!
I'll handle the ground operations!

1859
01:45:29,296 --> 01:45:31,298
-Seby, hurry up!
-Go!

1860
01:45:32,299 --> 01:45:33,333
-I need to go too, uncle!
-Wait!

1861
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,135
-Let go! Why is he running?
-You're pregnant. Don't run!

1862
01:45:35,202 --> 01:45:37,237
I said we have
a fuel emergency, goddammit!

1863
01:45:37,304 --> 01:45:40,407
I say again, Deccan Air 582, go around.

1864
01:45:40,474 --> 01:45:42,776
There is something wrong, Captain.
They're ignoring protocol."

1865
01:45:42,843 --> 01:45:44,811
Chennai Tower,
requesting reason for denial!

1866
01:45:44,878 --> 01:45:48,582
I say this again,
go around, Deccan Air 582!

1867
01:45:49,183 --> 01:45:50,150
Paresh,

1868
01:45:50,217 --> 01:45:51,418
this is highly risky.

1869
01:45:51,485 --> 01:45:53,921
Keep this up and that plane will crash!

1870
01:45:53,987 --> 01:45:55,856
You said you just wanted to scare them!

1871
01:45:55,923 --> 01:45:58,659
You're using civil aviation property
to blackmail him!

1872
01:45:58,725 --> 01:46:00,994
I'll be the one investigated!

1873
01:46:01,061 --> 01:46:02,029
How dare you?

1874
01:46:04,765 --> 01:46:07,568
You are not dumb enough

1875
01:46:08,202 --> 01:46:11,772
to piss off the man
who put you in the DGCA, are you?

1876
01:46:13,173 --> 01:46:14,775
You owe me, my friend!

1877
01:46:14,842 --> 01:46:15,876
Paresh...

1878
01:46:15,943 --> 01:46:18,011
we'll be in trouble if it crashes.

1879
01:46:18,078 --> 01:46:19,379
Stop this, Paresh! Enough!

1880
01:46:19,446 --> 01:46:20,347
Che, do you copy?

1881
01:46:20,414 --> 01:46:22,216
Tambaram Air Force. Runway 1-5.

1882
01:46:22,282 --> 01:46:23,517
Land there!

1883
01:46:23,584 --> 01:46:25,185
Do you have enough fuel for that?
I'll handle it!

1884
01:46:25,285 --> 01:46:26,320
Switch to our company frequency!

1885
01:46:26,386 --> 01:46:28,322
Who the hell are you
to give the instructions?

1886
01:46:28,388 --> 01:46:29,957
I own that fucking plane!

1887
01:46:30,023 --> 01:46:30,757
Let's go!

1888
01:46:31,758 --> 01:46:33,360
Guards! Guards, take him out!

1889
01:46:34,127 --> 01:46:34,962
Go! Go! Go!

1890
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:38,832
Che, listen, if the fuel is low,
switch to auxiliary engines!

1891
01:46:38,899 --> 01:46:41,401
Don't teach me how to do my job!

1892
01:46:41,468 --> 01:46:44,705
My dad always warned me
not to hang out with you.

1893
01:46:44,771 --> 01:46:45,939
I should've listened!

1894
01:46:46,006 --> 01:46:48,041
If anything happens to me,
tell Preethi I love her.

1895
01:46:48,141 --> 01:46:50,744
I'll tell that Brigadier's daughter, too.

1896
01:46:51,445 --> 01:46:52,813
Bring our plane home safely, man.

1897
01:47:00,621 --> 01:47:01,655
Keep going.

1898
01:47:08,395 --> 01:47:09,263
Come in, Che!

-Che?
-[siren wailing]

1900
01:47:12,833 --> 01:47:13,667
Get help!

1901

-He'll be okay, right?
-Open the emergency hatch! Hurry!

1902
01:47:20,174 --> 01:47:21,375
Sir, we are ex-Air Force officers...

1903
01:47:21,441 --> 01:47:24,244
We are ex-Air Force officers!
There are two pilots inside!

1904
01:47:24,311 --> 01:47:25,345
They need some help!

1905
01:47:27,047 --> 01:47:28,048
We're batch of '87!

1906
01:47:28,615 --> 01:47:29,550
They need some help!

1907
01:47:30,851 --> 01:47:32,853
There are two officers in there!
Help them!

[indistinct chatter]

1913
01:47:54,508 --> 01:47:55,342
Captain!

1914
01:47:56,944 --> 01:47:57,978
Jai Hind, sir!

1915
01:48:12,793 --> 01:48:16,263
Why didn't you declare Mayday
and land at Chennai Airport?

1916
01:48:16,330 --> 01:48:17,231
If we had declared Mayday,

1917
01:48:17,297 --> 01:48:19,633
they would've impounded
my flights for months!

1918
01:48:19,700 --> 01:48:20,934
That's what they want.

1919
01:48:21,001 --> 01:48:23,737
My launch is on August 25th.
And it must happen!

1920
01:48:24,171 --> 01:48:25,839
Excuse me, sir! Jai Hind, sir!

1921
01:48:25,906 --> 01:48:26,840
Call for you, sir.

1922
01:48:26,907 --> 01:48:29,510
The airport authorities
want an update for the press!

1923
01:48:38,919 --> 01:48:42,222
Three years ago, a Saudia Boeing
made an emergency landing.

1924
01:48:42,923 --> 01:48:44,258
On this very airstrip!

1925
01:48:44,424 --> 01:48:46,493
-Remember, Chaitanya?
-Sir.

1926
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,495
What did we do?

1927
01:48:48,562 --> 01:48:51,164
We investigated for terrorist links.

1928
01:48:51,231 --> 01:48:52,799
And then we levied a five-crore fine.

1929
01:48:53,333 --> 01:48:56,870
You three will get a ten-year prison term
along with the fine.

1930
01:49:03,277 --> 01:49:05,212
You haven't even taken off,

1931
01:49:06,113 --> 01:49:08,115
but you already have enemies
all over the country.

1932
01:49:11,385 --> 01:49:12,452
My investigation is done.

1933
01:49:12,953 --> 01:49:16,423
They aren't terrorists at all.

1934
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:18,692
Tell them I'm letting them go!

1935
01:49:18,959 --> 01:49:19,726
They'll pay a fine!

1936
01:49:21,094 --> 01:49:22,396
-Dismiss!
-Jai Hind, sir!

1937
01:49:24,965 --> 01:49:26,066
You will pay a fine!

1938
01:49:26,133 --> 01:49:28,602
For the unauthorized landing on our base,

1939
01:49:28,669 --> 01:49:29,903
the fine is 25,000!

1940
01:49:31,171 --> 01:49:34,041
You can pay three months after
you start your airline.

1941
01:49:37,477 --> 01:49:38,645
What are you waiting for?

1942
01:49:38,979 --> 01:49:40,814
A hug and a sendoff ceremony?

1943
01:49:41,148 --> 01:49:41,815
Go.

1944
01:49:43,116 --> 01:49:43,984
-Buzz off!
-Sir!

1945
01:49:44,484 --> 01:49:45,485
Maara.

1946
01:49:49,156 --> 01:49:51,925
They'll target you for letting me go.

1947
01:49:53,427 --> 01:49:55,562
Do I look scared?

1948
01:49:55,629 --> 01:49:57,998
You never liked me, sir.

1949
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:01,235
Maara...

1950
01:50:02,069 --> 01:50:03,737
If I had not punished you back then

1951
01:50:05,172 --> 01:50:10,110
my cadets wouldn't have respected me.

1952
01:50:10,177 --> 01:50:12,279
And if I bow to political pressure now,

1953
01:50:12,346 --> 01:50:13,747
I won't respect myself.

1954
01:50:13,814 --> 01:50:14,815
[in Telugu] Kid...

1955
01:50:15,749 --> 01:50:17,584
what you intend to do...

1956
01:50:19,086 --> 01:50:23,023
is much bigger than either of our egos.

1957
01:50:25,025 --> 01:50:29,596
A soldier must ensure
to bring every trooper home.

1958
01:50:30,063 --> 01:50:31,331
Like you did today.

1959
01:50:32,466 --> 01:50:33,901
You are a true leader.

1960
01:50:35,068 --> 01:50:35,903
Leader!

1961
01:50:41,475 --> 01:50:42,643
I don't smoke.

1962
01:50:43,544 --> 01:50:45,812
You shouldn't either.
You're getting old, right?

1963
01:50:46,313 --> 01:50:47,047
Hey!

1964
01:50:47,948 --> 01:50:49,650
[in Telugu] Don't you dare call me old!

1965
01:50:50,617 --> 01:50:53,520
Get out before I change my mind.

1966
01:50:54,221 --> 01:50:55,289
Get lost!

1967
01:51:08,836 --> 01:51:10,871
Mr. Maaran! Ready to fly, huh?

1968
01:51:12,739 --> 01:51:15,175
Are you inviting the minister? Good.

1969
01:51:16,577 --> 01:51:18,145
Need a recommendation?

1970
01:51:21,381 --> 01:51:23,684
Do you know Tata? Ratan Tata?

1971
01:51:25,686 --> 01:51:28,055
He himself couldn't start an airline here.

1972
01:51:28,689 --> 01:51:31,925
Poor guy tried for 20 years!

1973
01:51:32,392 --> 01:51:34,194
-Twenty years...
-You think you can scare me?

1974
01:51:35,229 --> 01:51:37,197
Going on and on about Ratan Tata!

1975
01:51:37,331 --> 01:51:38,899
I'm not Ratan Tata, damn it!

1976
01:51:39,333 --> 01:51:40,734
People trust me.
That's more than enough.

1977
01:51:41,368 --> 01:51:42,503
People?

1978
01:51:43,103 --> 01:51:44,171
Public opinion?

1979
01:51:44,872 --> 01:51:46,540
That changes every week!

1980
01:51:47,541 --> 01:51:50,043
Be careful, Mr. Maaran.

1981
01:51:50,811 --> 01:51:51,712
Excuse me.

1982
01:51:52,613 --> 01:51:54,281
I have an airline to run, my friend.

1983
01:51:55,382 --> 01:51:56,884
It's my time now.

1984
01:52:02,022 --> 01:52:03,524
The people are with him.

1985
01:52:03,624 --> 01:52:06,159
You keep swatting this bee
but it continues to fly.

1986
01:52:07,895 --> 01:52:08,896
Murthy?

1987
01:52:10,030 --> 01:52:11,498
-Murthy!
-Sir!

1988
01:52:12,132 --> 01:52:13,133
It's Marudhu, sir.

1989
01:52:13,233 --> 01:52:14,234
Right, Marudhu!

1990
01:52:15,235 --> 01:52:16,170
Marudhu...

1991
01:52:17,304 --> 01:52:19,139
Do you know Nedumaaran Rajangam?

1992
01:52:20,274 --> 01:52:21,275
I do, sir.

1993
01:52:21,742 --> 01:52:23,010
What do you know?

1994
01:52:23,143 --> 01:52:26,079
I heard he's offering
plane tickets at low price.

1995
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:28,315
You'll make people fly for just one-rupee?

1996
01:52:28,382 --> 01:52:29,216
Impossible!

1997
01:52:29,283 --> 01:52:31,618
Today, 75% of flights fly half-empty!

1998
01:52:31,685 --> 01:52:33,620
I'll charge a rupee for each empty seat.

1999
01:52:33,687 --> 01:52:36,857
Just a rupee for those who book
much in advance in my airlines.

2000
01:52:37,791 --> 01:52:40,027
Once those are booked,
500 rupee seats open up!

2001
01:52:40,093 --> 01:52:41,228
Then, the 1,000s!

2002
01:52:41,295 --> 01:52:45,165
But aren't you deceiving people
by giving just ten one rupee tickets?

2003
01:52:45,232 --> 01:52:47,768
Three planes. Ten trips each per day.

2004
01:52:47,868 --> 01:52:50,871
That is 300 people will fly
at one-rupee, per day.

2005
01:52:51,104 --> 01:52:54,274
And even our most expensive ticket
costs the same as a train ticket.

2006
01:52:54,608 --> 01:52:55,809
Will you go in that plane?

2007
01:52:56,510 --> 01:52:58,078
I don't know if I will, sir.

2008
01:52:58,879 --> 01:53:02,716
But I want my mother to fly
at least once.

2009
01:53:04,017 --> 01:53:05,452
She'll love it.

2010
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:09,556
There are two unused airstrips
in your region.

2011
01:53:09,623 --> 01:53:12,693
Imagine the impact
when these planes land there!

2012
01:53:15,863 --> 01:53:20,000
So my servant will fly with me
as an equal?

2013
01:53:20,067 --> 01:53:21,935
And I'm supposed to let that happen?

2014
01:53:22,002 --> 01:53:23,136
His investment.

2015
01:53:24,304 --> 01:53:25,739
That must be destroyed first.

2016
01:53:25,906 --> 01:53:29,243
We're proud to cover
the launch of this airline

2017
01:53:29,309 --> 01:53:31,678
that could be a significant milestone
in the history of Indian aviation...

2018
01:53:31,745 --> 01:53:34,915
Back in the day, I told the teacher
his son would fly.

2019
01:53:34,982 --> 01:53:36,583
And he has!

2020
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:39,853
I hereby announce two airstrips
will be operated in my region alone!

2021
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:41,488
I've always been a visionary.

2022
01:53:41,555 --> 01:53:44,391
We must encourage the youth of our nation.

2023

01:56:10,137 --> 01:56:11,138
Come along, sir!

2055
01:56:11,405 --> 01:56:12,472
What is this?

2056
01:56:13,574 --> 01:56:14,808
Steer clear of the aircraft!

2057
01:56:14,875 --> 01:56:16,643
Stay back! Move away!

2058
01:56:20,013 --> 01:56:22,716
Relax, sir. Please wait in the lounge.
I'll set things right.

2059
01:56:22,783 --> 01:56:23,951
How much longer, Che?

2060
01:56:24,017 --> 01:56:26,353
Forty-five minutes! I'm on it!
Just give me some time!

2061
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:27,788
Sir... I'll get everything alright...

2062
01:56:27,855 --> 01:56:29,756
This is a failure! Drive!

2063
01:56:29,823 --> 01:56:31,425
Sir, please don't say that!

2064
01:56:31,491 --> 01:56:33,493
-Drive!
-Sir... Sir...

2065
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:34,561
Please wait, sir!

His problem is he aims too high!

Will anyone pledge fertile land?

2069
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:45,405
Our lands are going up in smoke!

2070

Shut up, Esakki! Or I'll kill you!

2071
01:56:47,708 --> 01:56:48,675
You shut up!

[reporters clamoring]

2074
01:57:01,722 --> 01:57:04,258
What's the cause of the accident?
We need an answer!

2075
01:57:04,324 --> 01:57:06,593
The first trip, with a minister on board,
ended in disaster!

2076
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:08,395
Your cheap tickets will claim lives.

2077
01:57:08,462 --> 01:57:09,463
It was not our intention.

2078
01:57:09,530 --> 01:57:11,431
Did you not follow safety regulations?

2079
01:57:11,565 --> 01:57:13,534
As per the international regulations,
Deccan Air...

2080
01:57:13,634 --> 01:57:16,136
-Answer us, Maaran!
-People deserve the truth!

2081
01:57:16,203 --> 01:57:17,804
-Are you scared to answer?
-Answer us!

2082
01:57:17,871 --> 01:57:20,240
-Why are you silent?
-Answer us!

2083
01:57:21,575 --> 01:57:22,576
Speak up!

2084
01:57:23,410 --> 01:57:25,379
Is human life worth so little to you?

2085
01:57:25,445 --> 01:57:26,613
How is this fair?

2086
01:57:27,381 --> 01:57:28,582
Mr. Maaran, I'm talking to you.

2087
01:57:28,649 --> 01:57:30,751
-Answer my question!
-I'm explaining that.

01:57:47,267 --> 01:57:48,235
I'll handle this!

01:57:50,771 --> 01:57:51,772
You handle them!

01:57:55,175 --> 01:57:56,877
Uncle, let's...

2093
01:58:07,354 --> 01:58:10,090
Is it true you did not follow
safety regulations?

2094
01:58:10,157 --> 01:58:12,659
Sir, as per international regulations,

2095
01:58:12,726 --> 01:58:14,661
we did C&D checks in India and France!

2096
01:58:14,728 --> 01:58:18,265
Our goal was low-priced airlines,
not undermining safety.

2097
01:58:18,332 --> 01:58:21,268
India has so many basic issues!
Is flying a necessity?

2098
01:58:21,335 --> 01:58:23,837
Every benefit must reach everyone!
And they will!

2099
01:58:23,904 --> 01:58:26,740
This is my domain.
And I want to break the barriers here!

2100
01:58:27,207 --> 01:58:27,841
Is that wrong?

2101
01:58:27,908 --> 01:58:29,776
These philosophies are good, Maaran!

2102
01:58:30,310 --> 01:58:32,312
Hear me out!

2103
01:58:32,379 --> 01:58:35,415
We did all due diligence!
No rules were violated!

2104
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:37,584
-Yeah.
-Stop, sir!

2105

[reporters clamoring]

2106
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:41,989
People are not about to get into
one of these flights in a hurry.

2107
01:58:42,055 --> 01:58:44,591
People will not fly Deccan Air again.

2108
01:58:44,658 --> 01:58:46,994
This may well be their last flight.

Good enough if people fly.

Yeah, we're clear for morning departure.

2113
02:00:08,509 --> 02:00:10,010
So shall we issue a CRS?

02:00:11,011 --> 02:00:13,113
Yeah. Go check!

Has the oil been uplifted, Che?

2116

They've assigned Bay 64 to us.

Mr. Rajiv Manohar.

2118
02:00:28,762 --> 02:00:32,165
Your statement says that
Deccan Air violated many safety rules.

2119
02:00:32,232 --> 02:00:33,734
Can you please elaborate?

2120
02:00:34,301 --> 02:00:36,436
What crimes
did Deccan Air commit? Tell us.

2121
02:00:37,171 --> 02:00:39,373
Is it true
that Deccan Air was indifferent?

2122
02:00:45,245 --> 02:00:46,246
No, sir.

2123
02:00:47,347 --> 02:00:48,882
This is all my fault.

2124
02:00:50,484 --> 02:00:53,287
What's this, sir?
He keeps changing his statement!

2125
02:00:53,353 --> 02:00:57,157
Did someone force you
to sabotage Deccan Air's flight?

2126
02:00:57,224 --> 02:01:00,861
I was negligent during fueling.

2127
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:02,930
I didn't do my safety checks properly.

2128
02:01:02,996 --> 02:01:04,731
It's my fault.

2129
02:01:05,365 --> 02:01:06,834
Is someone threatening you?

2130
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:09,436
We all know who is threatening whom.

2131
02:01:10,537 --> 02:01:13,106
Please explain that, Mr. Manohar.

2132
02:01:13,173 --> 02:01:14,308
Who is threatening you?

2133
02:01:14,374 --> 02:01:15,776
He already answered it.

2134
02:01:16,777 --> 02:01:19,513
I'm satisfied with his statement.
It's okay.

2135
02:01:19,580 --> 02:01:21,615
Deccan Air is not at fault.

2136
02:01:21,682 --> 02:01:23,617
File the report as Pilot Negligence.

2137
02:01:23,984 --> 02:01:25,719
It was not a technical failure.

2138
02:01:26,019 --> 02:01:27,855
Deccan Air is cleared of all charges.

I trusted you, Captain.

2140

I have many financial problems at home.

Worse than mine?

They'll try to buy us, sir.

2143

Saying no is our only strength!

or charge the damn thing?

I'm not going.

2153
02:02:19,907 --> 02:02:22,109
-It could be useful to us.
-Yes.

2154
02:02:22,242 --> 02:02:23,744
I don't want his help!

2155
02:02:23,844 --> 02:02:26,146
The shape we're in,
we need all the help we can get.

2156
02:02:27,181 --> 02:02:29,750
I'm not going to do business
with such people.

2157
02:02:32,352 --> 02:02:34,054
I'm taking the evening bus home.

2158

Don't stress. Whenever you say!

2163
02:02:50,304 --> 02:02:53,607
Just indicate a date,
and I'll manage the rest.

2164
02:02:54,875 --> 02:02:56,076
See you. Bye, Bommi!

2165
02:02:56,143 --> 02:02:57,244

2166
02:03:00,247 --> 02:03:01,248

on its future.

2171

The people's faith in Deccan Air...

2172
02:03:11,158 --> 02:03:13,026
Running an airline is not a game!

2173
02:03:13,093 --> 02:03:14,294
No wonder it tanked!

2174
02:03:14,361 --> 02:03:17,364
Airplanes are for the rich!
Not for people like us!

Paresh Goswami questions
if the DGCA enquiry commission was bribed.

2176
02:03:21,401 --> 02:03:23,103
Even our advertisement has been buried!

2177
02:03:23,170 --> 02:03:25,973
They play with our feelings
and royally screw us!

2178
02:03:26,106 --> 02:03:27,741
No one is listening to us!

2179
02:03:29,977 --> 02:03:33,247
Due to safety issues,
Deccan Air has come to an end.

2180
02:03:33,313 --> 02:03:35,082
They broke people's trust in us.

2181
02:04:08,115 --> 02:04:10,150
A plane, Maara! Come on! Race!

2182
02:04:11,084 --> 02:04:12,319
Maara.

2183
02:04:15,789 --> 02:04:16,723
Welcome.

2184
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:17,824
Come have a drink.

2185
02:04:17,891 --> 02:04:18,992
No, we're good.

2186
02:04:19,059 --> 02:04:21,161
Go ahead, have a drink, man. Have fun!

2187
02:04:21,895 --> 02:04:23,997
Okay, I'll get to the point.

2188
02:04:24,064 --> 02:04:25,265
Why do we need two airlines?

2189
02:04:25,332 --> 02:04:29,503
I'll merge your company with mine.

2190
02:04:29,570 --> 02:04:30,771
Who will fly in our planes then?

2191
02:04:30,838 --> 02:04:32,573
Only the rich, of course!

2192
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:35,409
My team said a maximum of twelve crores.

2193
02:04:35,475 --> 02:04:37,744
But I'll give you fifteen crores!

2194
02:04:39,112 --> 02:04:40,848
Guys, do we have a deal?

2195
02:04:42,616 --> 02:04:44,484
Okay. Sixteen crores, then!

2196
02:04:47,821 --> 02:04:51,458
Maaran, you better take it
before I change my mind.

2197
02:04:51,525 --> 02:04:53,861
Give us two minutes.
We'll discuss and get back to you.

2198
02:04:54,294 --> 02:04:55,162
Okay.

2199
02:04:55,963 --> 02:04:58,232
Maara... Let's think it over, Maara.

2200
02:04:58,298 --> 02:04:59,333
I already have.

2201
02:04:59,733 --> 02:05:00,400
No.

2202
02:05:01,101 --> 02:05:02,436
Why are you taking a risk?

2203
02:05:02,503 --> 02:05:04,271
It's a great offer. Take it!

2204
02:05:06,773 --> 02:05:09,276
Sometimes I get doubts
about my airline's success.

2205
02:05:10,277 --> 02:05:12,079
But the way you're lusting after it.

2206
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:14,748
my doubts are all gone.

2207
02:05:14,848 --> 02:05:17,417
Come on. You've no business sense.

2208
02:05:17,484 --> 02:05:21,288
You can't survive a day here
without my support.

2209
02:05:21,355 --> 02:05:23,557
I don't understand you guys.

2210
02:05:23,624 --> 02:05:25,092
You won't.

2211
02:05:25,158 --> 02:05:27,261
You're a socialite. I'm a socialist.

2212
02:05:28,228 --> 02:05:30,597
We are nothing alike.

2213
02:05:30,664 --> 02:05:32,232
Imbecile!

2214
02:05:32,299 --> 02:05:33,367
Let's go!

2215
02:05:34,301 --> 02:05:36,170
-Did he call me an imbecile?
-Yes, sir.

2216
02:05:37,638 --> 02:05:39,706
How can you decide alone?

2217
02:05:39,806 --> 02:05:41,341
Don't you need to discuss it with us?

2218
02:05:41,408 --> 02:05:43,410
I quit my job because of you!

2219
02:05:43,477 --> 02:05:44,578
Is that nothing to you?

2220
02:05:45,612 --> 02:05:47,114
You call this a partnership?

2221
02:05:48,815 --> 02:05:50,384
You'll bring all of us to the streets?

2222
02:05:50,450 --> 02:05:52,219
-Che...
-What's your problem?

2223
02:05:52,286 --> 02:05:53,387
-Tell me!
-Back off, Che!

2224
02:05:53,487 --> 02:05:54,788
You're crazy!

2225
02:05:54,855 --> 02:05:57,157
Think about us too.
We all are in deep shit.

2226
02:05:57,224 --> 02:06:00,727
Seby has a family to feed!
My dad cut me off when I quit my job!

2227
02:06:00,794 --> 02:06:02,029
Aren't we human beings too!

2228
02:06:02,095 --> 02:06:05,199
Who can stick with you?
Is your wife happy at least?

2229
02:06:05,265 --> 02:06:07,000
-[both grunting]
-Hit me!

2230
02:06:09,169 --> 02:06:10,170
Go on, hit me!

2231
02:06:10,304 --> 02:06:12,539
Don't hit the bellies of the villagers
relying on you!

2232
02:06:12,606 --> 02:06:15,509
Am I? That dog inside doesn't get it!
Don't you, too!

2233
02:06:15,576 --> 02:06:18,278
By turning him down,
we make a billion Indians fly one day!

2234
02:06:18,345 --> 02:06:19,947
Why are we doing this!

2235
02:06:20,013 --> 02:06:21,715
Don't you know what he's bargaining for?

2236
02:06:23,150 --> 02:06:25,152
Our dream! Don't you understand?

2237
02:07:13,333 --> 02:07:14,301
How much did he offer?

2238
02:07:15,869 --> 02:07:16,870
Sixteen crores.

2239
02:07:17,771 --> 02:07:18,605
Did you take it?

2240
02:07:31,985 --> 02:07:33,687
I let down our family, Bommi.

2241
02:07:35,289 --> 02:07:36,390
Did you poison the food?

2242
02:07:37,658 --> 02:07:39,326
I would have, if you had sold out.

2243
02:07:52,039 --> 02:07:54,274
This is a small show on All India Radio.

2244
02:07:54,341 --> 02:07:56,510
It will do, ma'am.
It's the language of my people.

2245
02:07:56,577 --> 02:07:58,645
I'll talk to the new FM stations as well.

2246
02:07:58,712 --> 02:08:01,248
They're growing. You'll get a wider reach.

2247
02:08:03,684 --> 02:08:04,384
Ready?

2248
02:08:05,219 --> 02:08:09,990
Five, four, three, two, one.

2249
02:08:10,524 --> 02:08:11,191
Go.

2250
02:08:11,725 --> 02:08:12,593
Sir.

2251
02:08:14,461 --> 02:08:16,230
We look at the skies with awe,

2252
02:08:16,296 --> 02:08:18,699
but wouldn't dare dream
of seeing the world from up there.

2253
02:08:18,765 --> 02:08:20,167
People felt the same way
in my village too.

2254
02:08:20,234 --> 02:08:23,604
But today, we've risen too
and come to fly.

2255
02:08:23,670 --> 02:08:27,574
Goswami is afraid of sub-standard people
entering the industry.

2256
02:08:28,108 --> 02:08:30,177
Yes. He is terrified of us.

2257
02:08:30,244 --> 02:08:31,645
But not for the reasons he claims.

2258
02:08:31,712 --> 02:08:33,080
He knows very well

2259
02:08:33,146 --> 02:08:36,250
that our airline passed every safety test
as his airlines did.

2260
02:08:36,316 --> 02:08:37,484
So, what does he fear?

2261
02:08:37,551 --> 02:08:41,555
He fears that those beneath him
will rise to his level.

2262
02:08:41,622 --> 02:08:44,625
The rich want the poor to remain poor.

2263
02:08:45,959 --> 02:08:48,495
A century ago, they claimed
electricity was only for the rich.

2264
02:08:48,562 --> 02:08:50,764
Fifty years ago,
they said the same about the cars.

2265
02:08:50,831 --> 02:08:51,732
Who are they to decide?

2266
02:08:51,798 --> 02:08:55,235
Because others should not
enjoy this except them.

2267
02:08:55,769 --> 02:08:59,239
We spend days to go from place to place.

2268
02:08:59,306 --> 02:09:00,607
But the rich...

2269
02:09:01,475 --> 02:09:03,544
They fly like Gods above us!

2270
02:09:03,610 --> 02:09:06,647
If we level with them,
no one will be beneath them.

2271
02:09:06,813 --> 02:09:07,981
That's what he fears!

2272
02:09:08,048 --> 02:09:11,318
You can now book plane tickets
over the phone!

2273
02:09:11,385 --> 02:09:13,187
We will give you a PNR number.

2274
02:09:13,253 --> 02:09:17,691
Just show the number
at your bank or post office.

2275
02:09:17,858 --> 02:09:19,860
Why do small towns remain small?

2276
02:09:19,927 --> 02:09:20,894
Why haven't they grown?

2277
02:09:20,961 --> 02:09:23,330
If we want to grow,
sometimes we must walk

2278
02:09:23,397 --> 02:09:24,631
sometimes, we must run,

2279
02:09:24,698 --> 02:09:26,567
and sometimes, we have to fly!

2280
02:09:27,067 --> 02:09:29,736
That is called as air connectivity.

2281
02:09:29,803 --> 02:09:32,539
My airline promises
air connectivity to everyone.

2282
02:09:32,639 --> 02:09:35,175
Our planes will reach every small town!

2283
02:09:35,242 --> 02:09:38,011
Not only Chennai, every place will grow.

2284
02:09:38,078 --> 02:09:41,782
Won't that scare the privileged?

2285
02:09:44,017 --> 02:09:46,320
The Question with Amit Trivedi.

2286
02:09:46,386 --> 02:09:48,989
-Thank you for joining us on The Question.
-Thank you

2287
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:51,658
Let's talk about
what's on everyone's mind,

2288
02:09:51,725 --> 02:09:52,826
"Low-cost aviation."

2289
02:09:52,893 --> 02:09:54,094
Your thoughts, sir?

2290
02:09:54,695 --> 02:09:55,762
Look, Mr. Amit.

2291
02:09:57,064 --> 02:10:02,603
When flying in an aluminum can
at 1,000km/hr,

2292
02:10:03,036 --> 02:10:04,438
what will be on your mind?

2293
02:10:04,771 --> 02:10:06,373
-Safety?
-Exactly!

2294
02:10:06,974 --> 02:10:11,078
That safety requires
all kinds of testing and security!

2295
02:10:11,178 --> 02:10:14,648
It's expensive, but it is a must!

2296
02:10:14,748 --> 02:10:19,052
When someone offers to lower that price,
people must think hard.

2297
02:10:19,119 --> 02:10:20,854
They have a point, sir.

2298
02:10:20,921 --> 02:10:23,023
How can one feel safe at such low prices?

2299
02:10:23,090 --> 02:10:25,626
I have a question for Goswami on safety.

2300
02:10:25,692 --> 02:10:29,363
His first class tickets
cost three times more than economy.

2301
02:10:29,429 --> 02:10:30,931
If there was an accident

2302
02:10:30,998 --> 02:10:34,535
would he guarantee thrice the safety
to first class passengers?

2303
02:10:34,601 --> 02:10:36,036
But I will guarantee you this.

2304
02:10:37,204 --> 02:10:40,541
The Deccan Air pilots
flew fighter jets for India Air force.

2305
02:10:41,275 --> 02:10:44,044
Who can fly you safer than them?

2306
02:10:44,344 --> 02:10:49,049
Here is why we are afraid
of Nedumaaran entering airline business.

2307
02:10:49,116 --> 02:10:52,186
Shoddy equipment.

2308
02:10:52,286 --> 02:10:54,421
Retired pilots,

2309
02:10:54,488 --> 02:10:56,290
sub-standard products,

2310
02:10:56,356 --> 02:10:58,992
he brings in many dangers
like that.

2311
02:11:00,227 --> 02:11:03,263
The enquiry commission
cleared us of all charges.

2312
02:11:03,397 --> 02:11:06,567
I have no money to bribe them.

2313
02:11:06,633 --> 02:11:12,072
I won't pay bribes
with my people's hard-earned money.

2314
02:11:13,273 --> 02:11:16,143
If money was my priority,
I'd have made millions ages ago.

2315
02:11:16,210 --> 02:11:18,579
Or I'd gladly tend to my home and child.

2316
02:11:18,645 --> 02:11:20,480
Because my wife is very successful.

2317
02:11:21,481 --> 02:11:23,183
You talk of so many obstacles...

2318
02:11:23,951 --> 02:11:24,952
Why do you go on?

2319
02:11:26,353 --> 02:11:29,223
My father wanted electricity
in our village. We got it.

2320
02:11:29,289 --> 02:11:30,824
He wanted the train to stop.
And it happened.

2321
02:11:30,891 --> 02:11:33,527
And I want the benefits of modern science
to reach everyone.

2322
02:11:33,594 --> 02:11:36,864
I want to break the cost barrier
and the damn caste barrier too!

2323
02:11:36,930 --> 02:11:39,166
That's why our tickets cost one-rupee.

2324
02:11:39,233 --> 02:11:40,834
Not because of low quality.

2325
02:11:40,901 --> 02:11:44,304
When flying on a legacy airline like Jaz,

2326
02:11:44,371 --> 02:11:47,574
you're completely assured of safety.

2327
02:11:47,641 --> 02:11:51,778
As we have a well-trained crew
and the best infrastructure,

2328
02:11:51,845 --> 02:11:54,581
our ticket prices will be higher!

2329
02:11:54,648 --> 02:11:55,649
But...

2330
02:11:56,116 --> 02:12:00,687
Maaran is stripping away all this
and offering cheap tickets!

2331
02:12:00,754 --> 02:12:01,855
Tell me something.

2332
02:12:01,989 --> 02:12:04,791
is your life worth
the same as half a cup of tea?

2333
02:12:06,693 --> 02:12:08,161
My flights are safe.

2334
02:12:09,029 --> 02:12:11,899
All I'll say this to those who don't trust
our safety report.

2335
02:12:11,965 --> 02:12:13,700
This is my own safety test!

2336
02:12:13,767 --> 02:12:17,104
The three people I love the most
will be on Deccan's first flights.

2337
02:12:19,273 --> 02:12:20,274
My mother Pechi.

2338
02:12:22,876 --> 02:12:23,877
My wife Sundari.

2339
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:27,681
And my daughter Ammu.

2340
02:12:30,417 --> 02:12:33,787
Giving airlines to such people

2341
02:12:33,887 --> 02:12:37,157
is akin to giving guns
to the mentally ill!

2342
02:12:37,224 --> 02:12:39,092
This must be nipped in the bud!

2343
02:12:39,159 --> 02:12:41,028
It's very scary!

2344
02:12:41,094 --> 02:12:44,231
Listen to him some more
and even I'll believe him.

2345
02:12:44,298 --> 02:12:46,433
[reporters clamoring]

2346
02:12:47,801 --> 02:12:49,269
-Maara!
-Maara!

2347
02:12:50,003 --> 02:12:51,271
-Maara!
-Maara!

2348
02:12:52,005 --> 02:12:54,508
We've been trying to reach you!
What happened?

2349
02:12:55,909 --> 02:12:57,578
My cell battery is also dead, I guess.

2350
02:12:57,711 --> 02:13:01,181
You've not slept in three days.
You'll go crazy this way.

2351
02:13:01,248 --> 02:13:02,749
How can I sleep?

2352
02:13:02,883 --> 02:13:06,053
He could do anything to our planes.
We need to guard them.

2353
02:13:06,887 --> 02:13:07,855
Maara.

2354
02:13:25,172 --> 02:13:26,373
What's up, Nedumaaran?

2355
02:13:27,441 --> 02:13:29,476
Only Goswami has friends or what?

2356
02:13:29,877 --> 02:13:31,678
Don't we have friends?

2357
02:13:31,745 --> 02:13:34,381
We never let down our comrades!

2358
02:13:35,749 --> 02:13:36,783
Go get some rest!

2359
02:13:37,951 --> 02:13:39,052
I have this covered!

2360
02:13:41,121 --> 02:13:42,556
Boys, position!

2361
02:13:42,623 --> 02:13:43,457
[all] Yes, sir!

2362
02:13:54,801 --> 02:13:56,803
Take care of the wingtip clearance.

2363
02:13:57,638 --> 02:13:59,139
All in position at Bay 63?

2364
02:13:59,206 --> 02:14:01,775
...traveling flight DA 581,

2365
02:14:01,842 --> 02:14:04,044
please proceed to gate number two.

2366
02:14:04,111 --> 02:14:07,614
I repeat, all passengers
traveling to Thoothukudi

2367
02:14:07,681 --> 02:14:10,651
on flight DA 581,

2368
02:14:10,717 --> 02:14:12,686
please proceed to gate number two.

2369
02:14:34,341 --> 02:14:36,577
-Are we ready for boarding?
-Yes, Captain.

2370
02:14:36,643 --> 02:14:38,512
-Luggage tractors can go there, right?
-Yeah.

2371
02:14:43,083 --> 02:14:44,451
Welcome, Captain.

2372
02:14:44,518 --> 02:14:45,419
Welcome aboard.

2373
02:15:11,512 --> 02:15:13,947
It's faster to get to Madurai by bus!

2374
02:15:15,115 --> 02:15:17,951
Why is it that
only our plane is parked so far away?

2375
02:15:18,051 --> 02:15:20,387
No matter where they throw us,
our plane will fly.

2376
02:15:21,788 --> 02:15:22,523
Hello, ma'am.

2377
02:15:25,459 --> 02:15:26,827
-Go on.
-Good day, ma'am.

2378
02:15:26,894 --> 02:15:27,694
Sir.

2379
02:15:30,531 --> 02:15:32,432
We're really happy
to have you on board, ma'am.

2380
02:15:33,066 --> 02:15:34,434
There are no passengers?

2381
02:15:34,501 --> 02:15:35,969
There's still time, ma'am.

2382
02:15:38,972 --> 02:15:40,240
They'll come, won't they?

2383
02:15:41,375 --> 02:15:42,376
They will.

2384
02:15:47,047 --> 02:15:49,049
This is the last and final call

2385
02:15:49,116 --> 02:15:53,220
for passengers traveling from Chennai
to Thoothukudi on flight DA 581,

2386
02:15:53,287 --> 02:15:56,190
which is set to take off in a few minutes.

2387
02:15:56,256 --> 02:15:58,825
I repeat, this is the last and final call

2388
02:15:58,892 --> 02:16:03,363
for passengers traveling to Thoothukudi
on flight DA 581.

2389
02:16:03,430 --> 02:16:04,665
Cheer up! We'll handle it!

2390
02:16:12,372 --> 02:16:16,610
It's doubtful if people
will risk their lives and fly Deccan Air.

2391
02:16:33,026 --> 02:16:35,495
People will reject such an unsafe airline.

2392
02:16:35,562 --> 02:16:37,965
And yes, it does look like
the end for Deccan Air.

2393
02:17:03,724 --> 02:17:05,559
Our flight has been cancelled, Captain.

2394
02:17:52,506 --> 02:17:54,208
People didn't believe me, Bommi.

2395
02:17:56,844 --> 02:17:57,744
Let's go.

2396
02:18:03,617 --> 02:18:07,454
Airplanes are for the rich!
Not for people like us!

2397
02:18:07,554 --> 02:18:10,023
They play with our feelings
and royally screw us!

2398
02:18:12,326 --> 02:18:15,696
You're out of your league.
Go home and graze your cows!

2399
02:18:16,997 --> 02:18:20,133
Giving airlines to such people

2400
02:18:20,234 --> 02:18:23,370
is akin to giving guns
to the mentally ill.

2401
02:18:24,404 --> 02:18:27,241
Wow! He remembers the villagers plight!

2402
02:18:27,307 --> 02:18:30,010
Thought you'd forgot
as you were busy reproducing!

2403
02:18:31,245 --> 02:18:33,013
We are all praying for you, my son!

2404
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:34,381
You should win!

2405
02:18:34,448 --> 02:18:36,517
We are all counting on you. Win!

2406
02:18:38,485 --> 02:18:41,255
He spent just ten minutes
on you...

2407
02:18:42,556 --> 02:18:43,757
and you're in deep trouble.

2408
02:19:15,622 --> 02:19:17,057
Maara!

2409
02:19:20,294 --> 02:19:22,362
I'm sorry! I screwed up!

2410
02:19:23,096 --> 02:19:24,198
You trusted me!

2411
02:19:24,631 --> 02:19:25,866
-Forget it!
-I messed up!

2412
02:19:25,933 --> 02:19:28,302
We tried. That's what matters.

2413
02:19:28,869 --> 02:19:30,904
We came so close and screwed up!

2414
02:19:30,971 --> 02:19:33,574
I messed up the Chennai ticket booking.

2415
02:19:36,643 --> 02:19:37,644
What are you saying?

2416
02:19:38,312 --> 02:19:39,713
Be clear!

2417
02:19:39,780 --> 02:19:43,750
The Chennai flight tickets
were not confirmed from our end!

2418
02:19:44,585 --> 02:19:47,421
A software glitch caused
all booked tickets to get cancelled!

2419
02:19:47,487 --> 02:19:50,057
That's why none of our passengers came
despite booking tickets!

2420
02:19:53,861 --> 02:19:55,062
Maara!

2421
02:19:55,162 --> 02:19:59,499
They were unable to board our flight!
I'm sorry!

2422
02:20:05,239 --> 02:20:07,441
The problem was in the software!

2423
02:20:07,574 --> 02:20:09,142
People didn't lose faith in us!

2424
02:20:09,209 --> 02:20:11,812
Thousands of our tickets were sold!

2425
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:41,775
It's not that people didn't believe us,

2426
02:20:41,875 --> 02:20:43,944
The flights from Madurai to Chennai

2427
02:20:44,011 --> 02:20:46,346
and Vijayawada to Chennai,
they were fully booked.

2428
02:20:46,413 --> 02:20:48,682
The other planes were 100% occupied.

2429
02:20:49,183 --> 02:20:52,252
We won, Maara!

2430
02:21:05,465 --> 02:21:11,371
Your love brought the skies
Within our grasp!

2431
02:21:11,905 --> 02:21:16,910
This will live on, even when time is gone!

2432
02:21:18,245 --> 02:21:20,747
As tears filled our eyes

2433
02:21:20,914 --> 02:21:24,351
As scorched fields put up a fight,

2434
02:21:24,418 --> 02:21:27,321
A thousand flowers now in sight!

2435
02:21:27,387 --> 02:21:29,957
Time to smile, son!

2436
02:21:31,024 --> 02:21:36,763
Even a dried-up well with milk, can swell!

2437
02:21:37,531 --> 02:21:42,836
Even from a bitter herb, honey can flow!

2438
02:21:43,871 --> 02:21:46,540
Under the hot summer sky

2439
02:21:46,607 --> 02:21:50,143
A gentle drizzle floats by

2440
02:21:50,210 --> 02:21:54,147
As it falls on parched throats,
The town entire float...

2441
02:21:54,214 --> 02:21:56,450
-Maara!
-Grandma!

2442
02:21:56,583 --> 02:22:00,320
I'm so happy to have flown
in your airplane today!

2443
02:22:00,387 --> 02:22:03,223
I've dreamt for years to fly.

2444
02:22:03,290 --> 02:22:05,359
Even my son couldn't make it happen.

2445
02:22:05,459 --> 02:22:08,929
But today, with my own savings

2446
02:22:09,029 --> 02:22:12,032
I flew all the way here! How about that!

2447
02:22:12,766 --> 02:22:15,002
See you, son. Let's go!

2448
02:22:16,637 --> 02:22:18,005
Buddy...

2449
02:22:18,639 --> 02:22:20,941
Time to smile, son!

2450
02:22:28,749 --> 02:22:31,285
As she fed you, plate in hand,

2451
02:22:31,351 --> 02:22:34,988
Mother pointed to the faraway moon!

2452
02:22:35,055 --> 02:22:40,661
Now, the time has come
For mother to taste the moon!

2453
02:22:41,428 --> 02:22:47,100
The people who waited
With yearning looks in their eyes

2454
02:22:47,167 --> 02:22:48,802
They can now sail to the skies...

2455
02:22:48,869 --> 02:22:49,970
How was it?

2456
02:22:50,504 --> 02:22:53,640
For sorrow has met its demise!

2457
02:22:53,707 --> 02:22:59,713
They can now sail to the skies
For sorrow has met its demise!

2458
02:23:07,020 --> 02:23:09,690
"Pechi says he will fly.

2459
02:23:09,823 --> 02:23:13,861
But I know he won't rest
until he makes everyone fly with him!"

2460
02:23:13,994 --> 02:23:15,128
My darling!

2461
02:23:21,201 --> 02:23:22,202
My dear boy!

2462
02:23:23,070 --> 02:23:25,205
You've won! God bless you!

2463
02:23:26,373 --> 02:23:27,508
Bless you, my boy!

2464
02:23:39,152 --> 02:23:40,721
-Your father is back!
-[mobile ringing]

2465
02:23:42,422 --> 02:23:44,291
Hello. A call for you, Maara.

2466
02:23:44,391 --> 02:23:45,392
Watch what you say.

2467
02:23:45,859 --> 02:23:46,693
Hello?

2468
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:48,562
Congratulations, Mr. Nedumaaran!

2469
02:23:49,663 --> 02:23:51,932
Can we meet?
I have a business proposal for you.

2470
02:23:51,999 --> 02:23:54,902
I was expecting your call, Mr. Goswami.

2471
02:23:54,968 --> 02:23:56,837
Yeah, good!

2472
02:23:56,904 --> 02:23:59,806
I'll have my secretary
fix an appointment. Okay?

2473
02:24:00,407 --> 02:24:01,775
Who are you to give me an appointment?

2474
02:24:03,043 --> 02:24:03,744
What?

2475
02:24:04,344 --> 02:24:07,714
It doesn't matter whether I'm around now,

2476
02:24:07,781 --> 02:24:09,516
farmers have flown

2477
02:24:10,083 --> 02:24:11,518
and will continue to fly.

2478
02:24:11,585 --> 02:24:13,320
You don't own the sky, you scum.

2479
02:24:13,387 --> 02:24:14,288
Mr. Maaran!

2480
02:24:14,354 --> 02:24:15,489
Now fuck off.

2481
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:24,431
Take me on now if you will
Lay a finger on me, I go for the kill

2482
02:24:24,498 --> 02:24:28,902
I'm a beast on the charge!
Mowing down all as I march on!

2483
02:24:37,377 --> 02:24:42,449
Take me on now if you will.
Lay a finger on me, I go for the kill.

2484
02:24:51,725 --> 02:24:56,063
He's the reason behind middle-class people
being able to afford plane tickets.

2485
02:25:45,512 --> 02:25:46,280
Here.

2486
02:25:47,514 --> 02:25:50,083
Why are you messing with me, you hag?
What do you want?

2487
02:25:52,019 --> 02:25:53,253
Want to fly for a buck, huh?

2488
02:25:59,993 --> 02:26:02,162
[all cheering]

2489
02:26:07,935 --> 02:26:09,369
Forget the plane, buddy!

2490
02:26:09,503 --> 02:26:13,207
The cakes which they provided!
So damn delicious!

2491
02:26:13,340 --> 02:26:17,377
I'll fly over and over
just for these cakes!

2492
02:26:20,047 --> 02:26:21,048
Whose idea was it?

2493
02:26:21,114 --> 02:26:25,152
The sky awaits us all...

2494
02:26:25,219 --> 02:26:27,821
It's such a pleasure to meet up with you!

2495
02:26:27,888 --> 02:26:31,758
-How is everything, sir?
-How dare you sabotage the plane I was in.

2496
02:26:31,825 --> 02:26:33,827
Let's see how your planes are gonna fly!

2497
02:26:33,894 --> 02:26:35,996
Sir, please let me explain!

2498
02:26:39,166 --> 02:26:43,570
Those who call this a fool's errand
Just admitted to being fools!

2499
02:26:43,704 --> 02:26:48,208
They show up first in line to kiss up
When victory is met!

2500
02:26:48,342 --> 02:26:52,513
Those who call this a fool's errand
Just admitted to being fools!

2501
02:26:53,413 --> 02:26:54,715
First time flyer?

2502
02:26:54,848 --> 02:26:57,084
No! I've flown these things in circles!

2503
02:26:58,352 --> 02:26:59,520
It's okay.

2504
02:27:02,389 --> 02:27:03,757
Yeah... first time.

2505
02:27:03,924 --> 02:27:06,593
As we get closer, the dream grows nearer!

2506
02:27:11,098 --> 02:27:14,067
Let's sow big dreams in our heads!

2507
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:23,377
Any obstacle in our path,
Let's tear it to shreds!

2508
02:27:31,618 --> 02:27:34,087
-What do you do?
-I run a grooming establishment.

2509
02:27:34,221 --> 02:27:36,023
-What's that?
-I cut hair in my village.

2510
02:27:36,089 --> 02:27:37,724
-I see...
-Own business!

2511
02:27:37,791 --> 02:27:40,227
-And you?
-I run a business, too!

2512
02:27:40,294 --> 02:27:43,764
Don't you recognize him?
He has a huge clothing store in Madurai!

2513
02:27:43,864 --> 02:27:46,900
He gave 31 lakhs
to our fund for Maaran! A big man!

2514
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,702
There's no difference between us anymore!

2515
02:27:48,802 --> 02:27:51,772
He's broken down all that
and made us fly together!

2516
02:27:55,142 --> 02:27:56,210
Maara...

2517
02:27:57,744 --> 02:27:59,980
Did that girl fly the plane?

2518
02:28:01,481 --> 02:28:04,852
Stand by and do nothing?
It will never respect you!

2519
02:28:04,918 --> 02:28:06,987
To hell with business class!
Tear it apart!

2520
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:10,090
If they pay for tickets,
they can sit anywhere they want!

2521
02:28:10,924 --> 02:28:14,895
...won't it change one day
to a celebration sans failures?

2522
02:28:14,962 --> 02:28:17,497
Why are you hurrying to pay me back?

2523
02:28:17,564 --> 02:28:20,634
You'll need more money as you're growing.
Feel free to ask anytime!

2524
02:28:20,701 --> 02:28:23,003
We should make a film about you
and run it here!

2525
02:28:23,136 --> 02:28:25,472
You succeed and they
